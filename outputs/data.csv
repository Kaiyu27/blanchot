Sitting between philosophy and literature, his work explores the philosophical significance of literature by considering the demand it places on thought. For Blanchot, when thought is pushed to its absolute limit, we encounter the impossible, the singular, the outside—a radical region that is unthematizable. This, he argues, is ultimately the region of literature. Where everyday language tries to represent the world and where philosophical language tries to secure meaning, literary language, by contrast, is subversive as it does not carry the responsibility of representation or clarification. Words are not self-identical in literature, which means that the space of literature, as Blanchot refers to it, is characterized by an “atmosphere of uncertainty” (Blanchot 1985, p. 52, cited under Récit). This uncertainty is what drags us to the limit of possibility. Somewhat paradoxically, this limit/impossibility is not an invitation to nihilism, but rather the very condition of thought itself. It is no exaggeration to say that to understand Blanchot one must come to terms with this idea. Not only does this idea occupy his writing, but he also sees it in poets like Mallarmé, Rilke, Lautréamont; in the surrealists; and in novelists like Kafka, Proust, and Beckett. Much of his writing is dedicated to such figures. Given this demand placed on thought by literature, literature has the capacity to raise profound philosophical questions. Literature works like a springboard for Blanchot, impelling him to engage with the limit as it exists in philosophical figures like Heraclitus, Hegel, Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Heidegger, and Weil. Of particular importance are his engagements with Emmanuel Levinas and Georges Bataille. In Levinas’s account of the Other, Blanchot sees the ethical and political impetus of literature. In Bataille’s work, Blanchot sees a companion of the unthinkable and an explorer of the impossible. Such a range of topics means Blanchot’s writing is voluminous and varied, comprising his early journalism, his critical writings, his own works of fiction, and his fragmentary texts. In these writings, Blanchot shows himself to be an attentive, nuanced, and very demanding thinker. Reading Blanchot requires that we read with the historical, political, and cultural contexts in view, where disaster (e.g., the Second World War) looms or echoes and where culture is at a breaking point. This article will offer a selective bibliography to help one grapple with the demands Blanchot places on us and on thought itself.",Art | Atmosphere (unit) | Epistemology | Impossibility | Law | Linguistics | Literature | Meaning (existential) | Nihilism | Philosophy | Physics | Political science | Politics | Representation (politics) | Space (punctuation) | Thermodynamics,https://openalex.org/W4234452824,1.0,,"Crossref, OpenAlex",117

His novels, shorter narratives, literary criticism, and fragmentary texts exercised great influence over writers, artists, and philosophers. As a journalist and political activist, he had a public side that matched his secret and mysterious side as someone who refused to be interviewed or photographed. <italic>Maurice Blanchot: A Critical Biography</italic>, the only full-length account of Blanchot’s itinerary, therefore attempts to carry out an impossible bio-graphy. It does so by drawing on unpublished letters and on interviews with the writer’s very close friends. Beyond this, it is a theoretical work that follows the genealogy of a thinking that is at once imaginative and speculative, at once aligned with literary modernity and a close companion and friend of philosophy. It is a historical work, unpacking the ‘transformation of convictions’ of an author who moved from the far-right in the 1930s to the far-left in the 1950s and after. And it is of course a biography, showing the strong links between the author’s life and an œuvre which nonetheless aspires to anonymity. In these ways, this book claims that Blanchot’s is a life that has become the œuvre, become a literature that bears the traces of that life secretly, even if they are what drives it. Blanchot’s œuvre is reconstituted in all its contexts, at a time when the critics who attack it, just like those who elevate it in unthinking fascination, often produce one-dimensional readings.",Art | Art history | Biography | Criticism | Epistemology | History | Law | Literature | Modernity | Narrative | Philosophy | Political science | Politics,https://openalex.org/W4253588740,2.0,,"Crossref, OpenAlex",115

This enduring controversy stems not only from Heidegger's undeniably horrendous politics, legendarily difficult prose, and profoundly challenging views, but also from the fact that a list of the major thinkers inspired by the works he wrote after Being and Time (1927) reads like the required table of contents for any good anthology of “contemporary continental philosophy”: Giorgio Agamben, Alain Badiou, Jean Baudrillard, Maurice Blanchot, Stanley Cavell, Gilles Deleuze, Jacques Derrida, Hubert Dreyfus, Michel Foucault, Luce Irigaray, Jacques Lacan, Emmanuel Levinas, Jean-François Lyotard, Herbert Marcuse, Jacques Rancière, Richard Rorty, Charles Taylor, Gianni Vattimo, and Slavoj Žižek. For all these “postmodernists” (the heading under which this diverse group is often lumped together), Heidegger's later philosophy served as a formative influence as well as a primary point of departure. Yet, despite his immense influence, Heidegger's own philosophical attempt to articulate a postmodern understanding of being – and so help usher in a postmodern age – remains shrouded in darkness and confusion along with the other views at the heart of his later thought.

Almost as an uncanny nod to Kristeva’s own unorthodox personal and academic history, which is most often singularly on the border of disciplines and genres, the contributors’ training and academic interests range from literature to linguistics to philosophy to psychoanalysis to religious studies. Sexuality and gender as structured through language, the imprint of desire upon life, the instances of the unconscious that escape the censorship of the repressed to reappear in language, and the complex net of reading/writing/creativity and intertextuality: these are some of the key issues that the present essays explore. The shared interest of the contributors in the psychic life and gendered existence of the individual and in the reinterpretation of literary texts matches the perennial interest in Kristeva and her continuous return both in her theoretical and fictional works and in her basic yet overwhelming questions about our humanity. Kristeva’s voice has been influential among scholars for some forty years now despite the numerous debates her work engenders and the criticism she continuously faces on both sides of the Atlantic. The authors in this special issue seek to re-examine yet again the theoretical work of the philosopher and psychoanalyst as well as the fictional work of the novelist Kristeva, and to pit that corpus against the texts of influential twentieth-century writers including Toni Morrison, Sylvie Courtine-Denamy, Jean Rhys, Angela Carter, Zinaida Gippius, and Liudmila Vilkina. In his essay “The Monstrous Crossroads of Kristeva’s Textual Practice,” Dawid Kołoszyc offers a comprehensive analysis of Kristeva’s theory and textual practices vis-à-vis the textual practices of two important French thinkers of the twentieth century, Maurice Blanchot and Jacques Derrida, who have made important contributions to critical theory and the interpretation of literature. Kołoszyc highlights the points of convergence between the three thinkers and argues that Kristeva’s textual practice can be understood [End Page v] as an ongoing crisscrossing and negotiation between two seemingly opposite views of reading and writing: Blanchot’s conceptualization of the reading and writing practices as a “descent into the silent, bottomless abyss of the text” and Derrida’s “endless movement across the textual surface through deferral, dissemination, iterability, and supplementarity” (2). Kołoszyc also reviews some of the key concepts in Kristeva’s corpus—the widely discussed chora and semanalysis and also the important ideas of productivity and intertextuality that are integral to the understanding of her theoretical and fictional work. In an interview, Kristeva comments on contemporary art and points out that it examines types of “fragility,” the fragility of “perversion, that is, all sorts of sexual transgressions” (“Interview”). Literature especially is a strong material testimony for the existence of such transgressions made public by means of the aesthetic use of language. Kristeva further explains, This is ever the case with literature and when it does not try to treat perversion, it deals with psychotic states, that is, the states of identity loss, the loss of language, the borderline cases which cohabit and coexist with delirium and violence, but all of this does not have to bear the imprint of something negative. (“Interview”) It seems that Kristeva pinpoints here the most important common feature between literature and psychoanalysis: both fields explore the existential difficulties entailed by the precipitation of the subject, in life as well as on the pages of a book. For those who have followed her writing closely through the years, this kind of research in subject-becoming is embedded unambiguously into another important discourse—the discourse of love. If in her early work Revolution in Poetic Language Kristeva analyzes the linguistic aspect of human interaction, her books in the 1980s, Powers of Horror, Tales of Love, and Black Sun, turn to the affective aspects of human existence. Kristeva recaptures in her later texts too this double bind between language and affect that structures the process of subject-becoming.

In the first part, the conceptual valences of the terms ""decision,"" ""between,"" and ""us"" are deconstructed by locating the force and form of shared-separation at the core of each of them. Next, the book's theorization of the inextricable relation between art and ethics is introduced, along with the post-Duchampian concept of the already-unmade (original to this study). In the third and final section, a philosophical genealogy of the notion/phrase ""the time of scenes"" is traced from an exchange between French philosophers Jean-Luc Nancy and Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe on the ""scene,"" back to Aristotle's Poetics. Descriptions of the six chapters of the book, and their relations to each other, are also presented in this section of the Introduction. Finally, Maurice Blanchot is given the last word by way of a quotation from his book, The Infinite Conversation, that provides a rather remarkable condensation of the language with which Ricco himself will theorize incommensurable and neutral forms of aesthetic and ethical interruption and separation, as the time and scene of the decision between us.",Philosophy,https://openalex.org/W4242073908,0.0,,OpenAlex,105

After questioning the claim that the turn to memory in contemporary theory and culture promotes a shift away from meta-narrative accounts of history and toward perspectival or post-modern accounts, the chapter situates memorial discourse in the context of such diverse modern themes as enlightenment, autonomy, progress, and historicist temporality. The argument is then made that these themes and projects are inadequate modes of response to the memorial dilemmas of a post-traumatic age. Given this inadequacy, this introductory chapter proposes to re-read canonical philosophies of memory of the modern period (John Locke, G. W. F. Hegel) in the context of later theorists of memory (Hannah Arendt, Walter Benjamin, Maurice Blanchot). While remaining mindful of where those classic texts conventionally lead, this chapter foregrounds the presence of disruptions of language, transmission and communication that open them up to new readings.",Aesthetics | Archaeology | Argument (complex analysis) | Art | Biochemistry | Chemistry | Context (archaeology) | Enlightenment | Epistemology | Hegelianism | Historicism | History | Linguistics | Literature | Modernity | Narrative | Period (music) | Philosophy | Temporality,https://openalex.org/W4210468447,0.0,,OpenAlex,105

Indeed, Martin Crowley, in the introduction to his edited volume Dying Words: The Last Moments of Writers and Philosophers , notes “the unavailability of death as an experience for the existential subject”; 1 in a similar vein, in his study of Blanchot, John Gregg writes of the verb “mourir”: “It is a defective verb that cannot be conjugated, for it has no forms in the present tense, nor can any personal pronoun serve as its subject.” 2 The impossibility of writing about death, and writers' attempts precisely to do so, constitute a paradox that has prompted wide-ranging debate reflected in the contributions to this volume. Death and writing the self are the focus of this Special Issue: in particular, the ways in which death affects autobiographical practice. In this last regard, a recent comment by Jeremy Tambling in his study Becoming Posthumous: Life and Death in Literary and Cultural Studies suggests that death, rather than life, informs our understanding and exploration of self in the present: “it might be better if we started with the assumption of death working through the living, and not dissociated, therefore, from our sense of the present.” 3 Dying Words: The Last Moments of Writers and Philosophers (Amsterdam & Atlanta, 2000), p. 2. Gregg cites Blanchot's words, “Mourir ne se décline pas” ( Le Pas au-delà , p. 147), in Maurice Blanchot and the Literature of Transgression (Princeton, 1994), p. 44.

Si les derniÃ¨res annÃ©es ont vu l'explosion d'une rÃ©flexion sur le genre testimonial dans son rapport Ã l'Histoire, aux Ã©vÃ©nements et Ã la subjectivitÃ©, le lien entre l'Ã©criture et la souffrance n'en demeure pas moins mystÃ©rieux et contestÃ©.

Comment Ã©chapper au risque d'une Â«bonne conscienceÂ», confort moral que crÃ©e une lecture qui par ailleurs glisse sur la peau au lieu de s'imprimer? On le sait: selon Elaine Scarry, la douleur excÃ¨de le langage; elle dÃ©borde la communication et, en ce sens, elle met Ã mal la transmission1. Si cela est vrai, il est impossible de concevoir un vÃ©ritable Ã©change entre un auteur et des lecteurs qui jamais ne pourront partager, mÃªme par l'imagination , l'expÃ©rience racontÃ©e. C'est cette aporie que nomme Maurice Blanchot dans L'Ã‰criture du dÃ©sastre au sujet du drame que vivent les survivants de la Shoah Â«le vÂœu de tous, lÃ -bas, le dernier vÂœu: sachez ce qui s'est passÃ©, n'oubliez pas, et en mÃªme temps jamais vous ne saurezÂ»2.

10.5325/jspecphil.33.3.0341,Introduction,Gail Weiss | Andrew Cutrofello,,2019,2019-09-01,The Journal of Speculative Philosophy,,article,en,False,"This special issue of the Journal of Speculative Philosophy offers a wonderful sample of the innovative scholarship that was presented at the fifty-seventh annual meeting of the Society for Phenomenology and Existential Philosophy (SPEP), which was hosted by Pennsylvania State University, October 18–20, 2018. We have chosen the title “Critical Phenomenologies: Past, Present, and Future” for this volume because the essays included within it pay close critical attention to temporally thick features of our everyday lived experience. While some of the essays would more readily be identified as “phenomenological” than others, all of them offer valuable contributions to the project of a critical phenomenology as Lisa Guenther describes it in Solitary Confinement: Social Death and its Afterlives. Critical phenomenology, she tells us, “continues the phenomenological tradition of taking first-person experience as the starting point for philosophical reflection and also resists the tendency to privilege transcendental subjectivity over transcendental intersubjectivity.”1 In addition, and equally important, critical phenomenology utilizes phenomenology's descriptive methodology not just to reveal what is positively present in a situation but also to highlight and address constitutive omissions, particularly those with social, political, and ethical implications. It is the critical phenomenologist's clear-sighted, incisive, yet loving attention to these lacunae, and her concomitant rejection of the abstract ideal of an ideologically neutral description of reality, that distinguishes this approach.Before providing more detail about each of the essays included in this volume, we would like to offer a quick tour of the table of contents to sketch out the trajectory of the volume as a whole. We begin with an essay by Robert Pippin, one of this year's plenary speakers, that presents his influential reinterpretation of Hegel. Next, we turn to the fundamental phenomenological domains of language, speech, and intentionality (Rachel Aumiller and John Montani's prizewinning essays). In the section entitled “Critical Intersections and Queer Interventions” our authors offer intersectional understandings of (de)coloniality (Emma D. Velez), freedom and invention (William Michael Paris), queer self-harm (Chris Jingchao Ma), and ability and disability (Joel Michael Reynolds). The next section, “Challenging Forms of Life and Thought,” includes essays on a Beauvoirian “art of living” (Céline Leboeuf), the nonrational domains of the unconscious and madness (Keith Whitmoyer and Hannah Venable), and the impossibility of distinguishing thought and information in our contemporary, virtually interconnected life (Brent Adkins). The final section, “Affecting Others and Othering Affects,” begins with an exploration of the role played by graphic texts in the experience and reception of Greek tragic dramas (Ian Maley) and then turns to Jan Patočka's account of how self-awareness “passes through the other” (Jakub Čapek). The third essay suggests that concentration camp prisoners' shame offers an affective resistance to dehumanization (Debra Bergoffen), and the concluding article reflects on the relationship between disgust and (the failure of) political judgment in Arendt's “Reflections on Little Rock” (Vilde Aavitsland).Pippin's “Idealism and Anti-idealism in Modern European Thought” clarifies the nature of Hegel's idealism and assesses the main lines of criticism that have been directed against it by anti-Hegelians such as Schelling, Marx, Adorno, Derrida, Lyotard, Levinas, and Heidegger. On Pippin's account, Hegel's idealism isn't a traditional metaphysical doctrine about ultimate reality (e.g., that nature is grounded in spirit) but rather a logical doctrine about the knowability of everything that can be known. He acknowledges that Hegel himself paved the way for misinterpretations of his philosophy by seemingly turning away from “purely ideal theory” to embrace “historical actuality,” only to identify a “rational core” of historical actuality that is “ultimately available only to pure philosophy or pure thinking.” According to Pippin, the key question for Hegel is whether or not reason is self-sufficient. If it is, as Hegel argues, then “pure thinking” is nothing but the process by which reason determines the form of the knowable. If it is not, as many of Hegel's critics have contended, then the onus is on the critics to explain how and why reason fails to recognize its own limitations. Pippin addresses three anti-Hegelian positions: those of Kant, Schelling, and Heidegger. He takes Heidegger to offer the “first genuine confrontation with Hegel in all of the post-Hegelian tradition” by distinguishing the intelligibility of beings (the topic of Hegel's Science of Logic) from “being as intelligibility itself.” Whether Hegelians should be troubled by Heidegger's challenge is a question Pippin leaves for his readers to determine.Aumiller's “Fantasies of Forgetting Our Mother Tongue” is the winner of the junior scholar award and is the first of the two prizewinning essays in this volume. Her essay brings together Derrida, Augustine, and Marx in an extended meditation on “the bond of the mother tongue.” She argues that this bond is inextricably linked to two fantasies: one that appeals to a mythical time “before” language (a position she associates with Augustine as well as psychoanalytic accounts of early childhood development) and another that invokes an imaginary time “after” language (a position she associates with Marx). Drawing on Derrida's reflections on Augustine and Marx—and on the relation in his work between spectrality and circumcision—Aumiller warns us of the dangers associated with the fantasy of escaping our mother tongue.In “Sense Experience and Poly-intentionality in Merleau-Ponty's Phenomenology of Perception,” graduate student award winner Montani develops a novel account of poly-intentionality through a close examination of Merleau-Ponty's analysis of the intimate forms of pre-reflective communication that our sensations establish between our bodies and the world. “Intentionality,” Montani asserts, “can be understood as a matrix of poly-intentional threads, woven by the body's different sense organs.” Understanding our sense organs as poly-intentional threads, he in turn suggests, means that each sense has the capacity to reveal the world in its own distinctive way.The essays included in “Critical Intersections and Queer Interventions” bring the fields of continental philosophy, decolonial studies, critical race theory, queer theory, and disability studies together in rich and groundbreaking ways. What unites all four essays is the way they foreground the experience of historically at-risk, marginalized groups, including black women, Latinas, slaves, queer youth, and people with disabilities. Both separately and together, these authors reveal the promise of intersectional approaches that seek to do justice to the distinctive forms of oppression as well as resistance that have historically been associated with each of these groups.Velez's “Decolonial Feminism at the Intersection: A Critical Reflection on the Relationship Between Decolonial Feminism and Intersectionality,” offers a critical analysis of María Lugones's “linguistic critique” of intersectionality, a methodology associated with the work of Kimberlé Crenshaw, Patricia Hill Collins, and other Black feminist theorists. Velez argues that Lugones's “coloniality critique,” which identifies and rejects categorial logics that are the result of colonial impositions, is not opposed to but actually “furthers the insights of intersectionality,” and she concludes that both an intersectional approach and a coloniality critique are equally necessary for establishing “decolonizing coalitions among women of color.”A central question in Paris's essay, “‘One Does Not Write for Slaves’: Wynter, Sartre, and the Poetic Phenomenology of Invention,” is whether literature can only be addressed to free subjects, as Sartre suggests, or whether it can and should be addressed to subjects who are not free, as Wynter argues. This leads to the broader question of whether literary invention itself presupposes freedom, as Sartre also maintains, or whether American slaves and other “blackened” subjects have inherited a liberal discourse of freedom that, as Wynter observes, “invents them as being wrong—desêtre.”Ma's “Silent Rage: Queer Youth Self-harm as a Protest,” resists dominant interpretations of queer youth's self-harming practices as an abnormal response to a difficult yet allegedly livable situation. Rather, Ma reads the high prevalence of self-harm among this population as a resistant response to the transphobic and homophobic harms that young queers face on a daily basis. More specifically, she argues that we should stop viewing “self-harm merely as the individuals' psychological capacity of managing emotions or a self-willing pursuit of pain.” For if we continue to do this, we run the danger of failing to hear “this silent protest.”In the final essay in this section, “The Meaning of Ability and Disability,” Reynolds offers a new interpretation of the interdependent relationship between ability and disability, a topic that is central to contemporary disability studies. His essay presents a tripartite framework to excavate the “meaning of ability” as it is both implicitly and explicitly articulated in our everyday lives. Its three dominant features include what he calls “the verdict of bodies,” “the bind of bodies and worth,” and “the dogma of individual ability.” To avoid being “stuck in well-trod, eugenic dead ends,” he concludes, all three must be rejected; instead, we should demand the resources we individually and collectively need to support “our shared precarity.”Our next section, “Challenging Forms of Life and Thought,” commences with Leboeuf's essay, “Simone de Beauvoir's Feminist Art of Living.” This essay seeks to remedy what Leboeuf argues is too intensive a focus on Beauvoir's conceptual contributions at the expense of what Leboeuf calls Beauvoir's “sensualism.” Turning to Beauvoir's descriptions of her hiking trips in her autobiographical memoirs, most notably The Prime of Life, Leboeuf reveals an implicit Beauvoirian “art of living” that warrants further examination in its own right. This art of living, Leboeuf suggests, arises directly out of “a sensual appreciation of the body” that can be achieved not only through hiking or rigorous exercise but also through meditation and other, less physical forms of bodily activity.In “The Wounds of Time: Phenomenology and the Problem of the Unconscious in Merleau-Ponty's Passivity Lecture,” Whitmoyer begins by reminding us that the unconscious has traditionally posed a problem for phenomenology since, by definition, it does not “appear” to consciousness and hence seems unable to be grasped as a phenomenon. In his Passivity lecture, Merleau-Ponty takes on this challenge directly and, inspired by Proust, suggests that the unconscious is, in Whitmoyer's words, “this profound forgetfulness that tears us apart, separating us from each other as well as from ourselves.” According to Whitmoyer, Merleau-Ponty's distinctive contribution to a phenomenological understanding of the unconscious as a nonpresence is the latter's depiction of the unconscious as an unhealed or open temporal wound, “the very wound that articulates our experiences and our lives.”Venable's essay, “At the Opening of Madness: An Exploration of the Nonrational with Merleau-Ponty, Foucault, and Kierkegaard,” focuses on another challenging phenomenon that defies reason, namely madness. More specifically, Venable argues that the dominant view of madness as “inaccessible and unintelligible” can be countered with a “tri-perspectival approach” that exposes the prerational, irrational, and suprarational dimensions not only of madness but of human experience more generally. Through a critical examination of madness as it is differentially depicted by Merleau-Ponty, Foucault, and Kierkegaard, she maintains, we can gain valuable insights into the central role nonrational experiences play in our everyday lives.The final essay in this section, Adkins's “Information as the Image of Thought: A Deleuzian Analysis,” starts with the Deleuzian claim that information should not be understood as a mere metaphor for thought since thought and information processing have become indistinguishable in our contemporary, globally networked society. He finds an unexpected source for this view in F. A. Hayek's 1945 essay on the distribution and processing of information, “The Use of Knowledge in Society.” Adkins also draws upon Claude Shannon's “Mathematical Theory of Communication”—which, as he observes, is usually credited with “single-handedly inventing information theory”—to advocate for a “noological” account of “the historicity and contingency of information as the contemporary image of thought.”While these four essays call upon us to acknowledge and affirm the physical, cognitive, and nonrational challenges of life, the essays included in “Affecting Others and Othering Affects” take up a different critical thread, directing our attention to specific, intersubjective dimensions of our affective lives. Together, they collectively reveal the limitations of the face-to-face encounter as a paradigmatic model of intersubjectivity since our responses to others and their responses to us affect us across space as well as time, and can be communicated through the written word as powerfully (and often more powerfully) than in person.Maley's “The Literary Relation to the Other in the Greek Tragic Text” reveals a “graphic relation to the Other” at the heart of Greek tragic drama, namely, the dramatist's own text. The affective power of the text, he argues, tends to be undervalued and overlooked in favor of the actual performance that brings the written lines to life on the stage. More specifically, Maley argues that we must “start with the tragic text through which the poet relates to the actor and from which the actor draws her performance” if we are to grasp the alterity that is so central to tragic drama. Drawing support from Blanchot, Derrida, Jennifer Wise, and Charles Segal, Maley rejects the classical Aristotelian move of grounding poetry within human nature or the being of the poet herself, emphasizing instead “the use of scripts and masks” in conjuring the Dionysian aspect of tragic drama.Socrates' appropriation of the Delphic maxim, “Know thyself,” is often portrayed by modern philosophers as a solitary (quintessentially Cartesian) undertaking that an individual self is supposed to perform without relying upon others. Čapek corrects this misperception in “Intersubjectivity and Self-Awareness in Husserl and Patočka.” He appeals to Jan Patočka's critical writings on Husserl to challenge the primacy of the detached self in self-awareness. Arguing that subjectivity is mediated by, or “passes” through, others, Čapek endorses Patočka's view that self-awareness is fundamentally intersubjective. Since each of us receives our understanding of ourselves through our encounters with others, it follows that “there is no first ego.”“From the Shame of Auschwitz to an Ethics of Vulnerability and a Politics of Revolt” by Bergoffen addresses the ethical and political implications of the profound bodily shame (and lack of bodily shame) that is powerfully (albeit differently) described by Primo Levi and Jean Améry in their respective autobiographical memoirs. For both Levi and Améry, the visceral experience of shame, Bergoffen argues, is precisely what “salvages” their humanity, preventing them from becoming Giorgio Agamben's “Muselmänner,” the “living dead” who are no longer capable of reacting to their “violated humanity.” As a “self-reflexive affect,” the experience of bodily shame, she maintains, “simultaneously acknowledges our vulnerability to the power and judgments of the other and rebels against the violence of degradation.” This form of resistance, Bergoffen claims, recalls Antigone's resistance to Creon's denial of her brother's humanity (by refusing the latter proper burial rites); what these examples reveal, she concludes, is the inseparability of an ethics of vulnerability and a politics of revolt.In “The Failure of Judgment: Disgust in Arendt's Theory of Political Judgment,” Aavitsland turns our attention to the political implications of another negatively charged affect, namely, disgust. Drawing directly upon Arendt's (Kantian) account of the inhibiting influence of disgust “on both the sensuous and reflective level of political judgment,” Aavitsland argues that the “aversion of disgust” is an “affective moment of judgment in its own right.” “[T]he attraction of beauty or the aversion of disgust,” she further suggests, “is the basis on which we include some and draw borders that exclude others.” Noting that affective responses (both positive and negative) that fail to “take the perspective of specific others into account” lead to failures of political judgment when they are not subjected to critical reflection, Aavitsland claims that Arendt exhibits just such a failure of judgment in her controversial 1959 essay, “Reflections on Little Rock.” Agreeing with Kathryn Sophia Belle's critique of the racist aspects of Arendt's political thought, Aavitsland also points out that the racist views exhibited in the essay fail to meet the demands that Arendt's own theory of political judgment requires. Thus, Aavitsland maintains, it is not the theory that should be rejected but the political theorist's failure to subject her own affective moments of judgment to critical reflection.Tracing a circuitous path from idealism to disgust, the essays in this volume all contribute to the project of a critical phenomenology insofar as they reflect on the ever-accumulating weight of the histories we have been told as well as on the more elusive burden of those that are yet untold. As so many of these essays illustrate, it is when we commit ourselves to looking backward and taking responsibility for the injustices that have been committed in the past, when we reject false illusions of complete objectivity or neutrality, and when we subject our own affective responses to critical reflection, that we may be best positioned (philosophers and nonphilosophers alike) to chart a course for a more just future.",Philosophy,https://openalex.org/W4229689200,0.0,,OpenAlex,104

Finalement par le langage, ce qui m'intéresse, c'est . . . [créer] une image qui bouge. (Anne Portugal)1 In the series of articles that constitute ""Gros Plans"", the work of established figures is presented alongside that of more recent or less well known poets without any intention to set up clear lines of influence between the generations. The articles represent a variety of approaches, on the part of both critics and the practitioners discussed. That the latter are not easily assigned to groups or movements says less about their work than it does about the relative lack of importance of such movements in the contemporary poetic scene. Different strands of poetry all retain a special status for poetic language, either separated from the world or still in direct reference to it. This alternative constitutes two ways of being ""metaphysical"", and also applies to lyricism: even form can become lyrical in the musical, rhythmic sense. Formalism corresponds to new ways of sensing the world, via abstraction, but still using rhythms, lines, and ""lines"" newly defined via displacement and spatialization. These poetic forms ""express"" through rejection of subjective expression, and embrace objective expression of form, employing resonance, tension, ruptures and interruptions. The approach adopted by the authors of the articles included in this issue—that of close reading of verbal and visual texts—is essential to an understanding of what such poetic practice is seeking to achieve as it questions and exceeds the limits of what might be called poetry. [End Page 129] Other languages Among the generic boundaries crossed in the articles on poetic practice presented here, philosophy figures prominently, but not in such a way that a theoretical position is applied to a text as a template. Rather, authors tease out the ways in which philosophy and poetry might independently be exploring the same preoccupations. Emily McLaughlin's analysis of the haptic potential of Bonnefoy's Début et fin de la neige via Nancy and Derrida allows for a reading in which the possibility of contact between self and world, and the failure of that contact, are both viewed as offering creative potential. In this way, the article troubles the accepted divide between poets, such as Bonnefoy, deemed to operate within a metaphysics of presence, and the work of Derrida, whose writing has been most influential in critiquing that metaphysics. Derrida is called upon on several occasions in other articles: when Eric Trudel explores the ways in which Alferi taps into the animal world to create an imaginary bestiary which also embodies his own conception of poetic gesture, rhythm, vitality, and when Elodie Laügt unravels the use of aphorisms in Godard and Cioran, thus reshuffling fixed notions of reference, temporalities, and artistic discourse. Barthes and Blanchot are called upon at key moments in the analysis of Levé's work by Luigi Magno, (an analysis profoundly based on the mis(use) and re- and de-contextualization of enunciatory processes found in the media), where Barthes's and Blanchot's ""le neutre"" combine to identify the unique ""timbre"" of Levé's works, between the personal and the impersonal, and between discourses. Geneviève Guétemme's commentary, itself based on a duality of means—criticism and photography—refers to Deleuze and Barthes, but also Rancière, to support her conceptualization of the entre-deux which she sees at the heart of Bonhomme's work, and which inspires her own poetic-photographic creation, without ever conflating both media. Clemence O'Connor shows that while Derrida, once again, may be an important reference (she cites a poem Dohollau dedicated to Derrida, and argues that there is a process of différance operating in Dohollau's work also), this need not be incompatible with a discussion of all that is ""other"" to language, a discussion that also makes reference to Benjamin and Heidegger. In Clément Layet's presentation of du Bouchet's Carnets, meanwhile, it is clear...",Aesthetics | Art | Art history | Computer science | Expression (computer science) | Humanities | Literature | Lyricism | Metaphysics | Philosophy | Poetry | Programming language | Rhythm | Romance | Theology | Transcendence (philosophy),https://openalex.org/W4250155375,0.0,,OpenAlex,102
10.5325/jspecphil.30.3.0235,Introduction,Alia Al‐Saji | Brian Schroeder,,2016,2016-08-01,The Journal of Speculative Philosophy,,article,en,False,"This special issue brings together some of the highlights from the fifty-fourth annual meeting of the Society for Phenomenology and Existential Philosophy (SPEP). Emory University hosted the conference on October 8–10, 2015, in Atlanta, Georgia. The articles included in this volume draw out, in plural ways, the trajectories, methodologies, and orientations that run through what we call today Continental philosophy. By mining the affective, imaginary, conceptual, and political dimensions of experience, they critically deepen and elaborate, indeed perform, not only what Continental philosophies are about but how they orient perception, feeling, and thinking. Hence our issue, “Critical, Affective, and Plural Trajectories in Continental Philosophy,” both reflects the trajectories sketched by current work in the field and gestures to a performative openness and pluralism, a thinking in movement, that these philosophical trajectories embody.The issue opens with the plenary address that Barbara Cassin delivered at the close of the 2015 SPEP conference. Cassin's article, “Translation as Paradigm for Human Sciences,” shows what it means for philosophy to be performative. Cassin takes her point of departure in her own experience of the Dictionary of Untranslatables, which has recently appeared in English (Princeton University Press, 2014). Itself a creative reworking of the French edition, Vocabulaire européen des philosophies: Dictionnaires des intraduisibles, which was published in 2004 (Éditions de Seuil) and became a best seller in France, this book is more than simply a dictionary or even an encyclopedia. Widely acclaimed as a novel and pioneering work, it shows the loving attention and critical dedication of its editors to languages—to the differences within and between languages, their equivocations and homologies, and to the difficult and endless experience of translating between them. Untranslatables, Cassin tells us, are “not what one doesn't translate but what one doesn't stop (not) translating.” Cassin notes how moments of untranslatability and resistance are “symptoms” of the differences between languages, but she argues against these becoming the bases for reifying any language into an “ontological nationalism.” Untranslatability is, then, not a barrier but an ongoing task that cannot come to an end. Moreover, this task is a philosophical one, Cassin argues, since to translate is already to do philosophy; philosophical concepts are not disembodied ideas but, rather, need to exist in words, in languages that perform differential worlds.Doing things with words, (re)making reality, is precisely what Cassin's Sophists are doing. Cassin argues for philosophy in terms of what she calls sophistics and shows this to be a discursive practice that is performative—in other words, rather than saying what is, this discourse produces its world. Cassin offers a forceful and creative rereading of the history of philosophy that critically engages with and challenges Heideggerian ontology—and which offers a different way of being pre-Socratic, namely, “logology.” Of interest here are the gestures of exclusion whereby Sophists become cast as irrecuperable, as nonphilosophy, even as nonhuman or plantlike—gestures that are replicated in philosophy today. The point for Cassin is not to rehabilitate the Sophists, to bring them back into the philosophical fold, but to take them as countermodels. This offers ways of resisting philosophical regimes of univocity and of performing a different relation of language and being. Here Cassin argues for what she calls a “consistent relativism.” Instead of the binary opposition of true and false, Cassin proposes a “dedicated comparative” that complicates the universal, makes it strategic, and takes into account context and locality; its purpose is not Truth as such but to help choose what is “better for.” In this way, Cassin shows how untranslatables are the basis not only of philosophical method but also of political method: “They deepen differences as a way of understanding, not through assimilation but by bridge-building.” This political gesture refuses the impoverishment of language in Globish (Global English), just as it refuses the sacralization of any national language. Translation is a political method that dwells in plurality; to translate, says Cassin, is to move between languages, without end, so “de-essentializ[ing]” any given language by “showing the gap, the entre, instead of fixed essences or unique ideas.” To translate is to remain with the multiplicity of, within, and between languages. In Cassin's words, it is to “philosophize in tongues.”The next section of the special issue brings together the three prizewinning articles by emerging scholars from the 2015 SPEP conference. The recipient of the Junior Scholar Prize was Erica Harris, whose article “Side-Stepping the Problem of the Unconscious: Why We Ought to Reframe the Lacan/Merleau-Ponty Debate in Bodily Terms” defends an unconventional, organic reading of the Lacanian “Real” that differs from interpretations of it as a lack produced by language. By relocating attention to Lacan's account of anxiety as an affect intimately related to the body, Harris renews the possibility of a dialogue between psychoanalysis and phenomenology and draws on Merleau-Ponty's later philosophy for clues in overcoming ambiguities in Lacan's own work on the nature of the Real. In 2015, the recipient of the Iris Marion Young Prize for the Best Paper in Feminist Philosophy was Shiloh Whitney. In “Affective Indigestion: Lorde, Fanon, and Gutierrez-Rodriguez on Race and Affective Labor,” Whitney attends to a different dimension of affect—the political economy of racialized and gendered exploitation in affective labor. Drawing on Gutierrez-Rodriguez, Lorde, and Fanon, Whitney argues that affective labor functions according to a logic of transmission and amplification, rather than use and exchange; it secretes an “indigestible” affective by-product that it becomes the burden of racialized bodies to carry. The Graduate Student prize in 2015 was awarded to Jasmine Wallace for her article “The Fragments of the Disaster: Blanchot and Galeano on Decolonial Writing.” In her article, Wallace attends to the plural and differential positionalities of historically marginalized communities in the work of remembering/silence. While Wallace draws on Blanchot's account of fragmentary writing, aimed at a silence anterior to language that could found future communities, she notes that, without a historical lens, such silence is in danger of being romanticized—compounding the oppression of communities whose histories have been forcibly fragmented. With Galeano, Wallace proposes a different process: to reconstruct memories of lost histories before refragmenting these narratives.The following five sections consist of articles chosen from among the papers that were either selected or invited for presentation at the SPEP conference. These articles cover a wide range of themes, figures, and topics—reflecting the deep diversity, but also the productive echoes, among presentations heard at the conference. Our special issue spans philosophies from their ancient to contemporary expressions. In addition to figures already mentioned, the issue includes articles on Augustine and Duns Scotus, Schelling and Nietzsche, Husserl, Derrida, Deleuze, Nancy, Henry, Barbaras, Malabou, and Le Dœuff. It broaches methodologies from the phenomenological and psychoanalytic, through the deconstructive and sophistic, to feminist, critical race, and decolonial approaches. But there are also themes that weave through different contributions, darting in and out, so as to create unexpected linkages; of these, it is worth noting the ways in which plurality (as we saw with Cassin) and affectivity (as touched on by some of the prizewinning articles) take different philosophical expressions in the rest of the issue.The first of these five sections, entitled “Rethinking Politics: Democracy and Community,” consists of two articles that draw on contemporary French philosophy to offer novel conceptions of the plurality of the political sphere. In “Derrida and the Autoimmunity of Democracy,” Fred Evans reconsiders Derrida's argument for the autoimmunity of democracy, questioning the guiding role that he assigns to an unconditional “democracy to come.” While Evans sees this as undoing the autoimmunity of conditional democracies, he also argues that the promise of democracy can be derived from a different aspect of Derrida's thinking: his philosophical use of “voice”—and what this implies for the political virtues of solidarity, heterogeneity, and the creation of new voices. In “The Clinamen of Community: Duns Scotus's Political Ontology,” Andrew LaZella responds to Nancy's question as to whether immanence can be undone through community. To answer this question, LaZella turns to an unlikely source: he finds in Duns Scotus's political ontology a powerful critique of immanentism. Though Scotistic univocity may appear totalizing, the inherent inclination—or “clinamen” (that is, “swerve”)—of univocal being ruptures the circuit of identity; being is always already being-as. Scotus thus allows us to think community as resisting both its hypostatization and its appropriation by individual subjects.The next section, “Aesthetics: Time-Consciousness, Memory, Imagin-ation,” brings together two articles that ask after phenomenological experiences of music and art. In “Rhythm and Transformation Through Memory: On Augustine's Confessions After De Musica,” Jessica Wiskus reads Augustine's Confessions as performing the very phenomenology of time-consciousness it describes. Key is the nonlinear work of memory disclosed in Augustine's notion of rhythm (through his interpretation of the hymn “Deus, creator omnium” in De Musica). This centrality of rhythm in the earlier text of De Musica sheds light on how the structural whole of the Confessions is organized rhythmically, performing a “beginning” that serves as origin only retroactively, through relation or proportion to the end. In “Toward a Husserlian Foundation of Aesthetics: On Imagination, Phantasy, and Image Consciousness in the 1904/1905 Lectures,” Azul Katz asks how a Husserlian aesthetic consciousness can be conceived. While Husserl did not write systematically on experiences of works of art, Katz considers two avenues for a Husserlian aesthetics. The first avenue, through image consciousness, would lead, she argues, to an overly narrow reduction of aesthetics to figurative and almost exclusively visual experience. The second, more promising avenue makes use of the heuristic model of phantasy; this widens the field of aesthetics not only to nonvisual experiences but also to oneiric and ecstatic phenomena. While this allows for a more creative aesthetics, the fluctuation, freedom, and spontaneity of phantasy pose a threat, according to Katz, to some of the methodological requirements of Husserlian phenomenology itself.The next section is entitled “Deleuzian Abstraction and Nietzschean Will to Power” and asks after the alternative ways in which these two philosophers conceive of thinking. In “Who Thinks Abstractly? Deleuze on Abstraction,” Brent Adkins argues that “abstract” is another way of talking about the intensive for Deleuze. In contrast to Hegel, who thinks of the abstract in opposition to the concrete, Deleuze thinks of the abstract in opposition to the discrete. Thus Deleuze can say that “lived experience” is “absolutely abstract” because it is rhythmic and intensive. In this sense, philosophy's failure is that it does not think life abstractly enough. In “Will to Power as Alternative to Causality,” Joshua Rayman shows the force of Nietzsche's critique of causality to be broader than Nietzschean naturalists conceive, for it deprives us not only of causal-scientific forms of explanation but of metaphysical explanation in general. But Rayman argues that the will to power, in its combination with eternal recurrence, provides a nonnaturalist, nonmetaphysical replacement for causal-metaphysical ways of thinking. It offers an alternative description of the origin of movement at work immanently in all events, such that there can be no temporal separation between prior and posterior events. Nietzsche thus integrates his thinking of will to power, flux, strife, time, and play with his destruction of metaphysics.In the next section, “Religion and Myth,” we see this concern with thinking extended to the role of revelation and myth in philosophical thought. In “Theology, Ontotheology, and Eschatology in Schelling's Late Thought,” Martijn Buijs asks how Schelling holds together revelation and philosophy in his late thought. While Schelling insists on the limited nature of a philosophy in which the highest principle is an eternal Absolute, he pursues philosophy in a different mode, in which God as God successively but never fully and finally reveals himself in history. Neither idealism nor theology, Buijs argues, this should be read as philosophical eschatology. Bryan Smyth's article “Merleau-Ponty and the Myth of Human Incarnation” offers a novel reading of Merleau-Ponty's early reinterpretation of Husserlian phenomenology. Smyth argues that Merleau-Ponty resolved the methodological problem of the external horizonality of experience, intuitionally, based on a mythic understanding of human embodiment. This implies that phenomenology, and human thought in general, involves some mythic outer horizon (whether this is recognized or not).In the final section of this issue, “Affectivity: Phenomenology, Psychoanalysis, and Philosophical Pedagogy,” we return to affectivity in its plurality. In “Renaud Barbaras and Michel Henry: A Contemporary Debate on the Status of Affectivity and a Farewell to the ‘Flesh of the World,’” Frédéric Seyler argues that Henry's and Barbaras's critiques of Merleau-Ponty's concept of the “flesh of the world” point to the compatibility of their phenomenologies of life. While both understand life as affectivity—desire for Barbaras and immanent affectivity for Henry—their analyses open different, but complementary, spheres of phenomenological investigation. The phenomenological sphere of existence developed by Barbaras continues to depend on the deeper, transcendental level given by Henry's radical phenomenology of life. Their combination, Seyler argues, would open the path to a more integrated phenomenology of life and existence.In “Trauma and Historical Witnessing: Hope for Malabou's New Wounded,” Jennifer Gammage criticizes the ahistoricity and affective emptiness that Malabou attributes to trauma victims and the supposed powerlessness of psychoanalysis to address these wounds. In contrast, Gammage, along with contemporary theorists and analysts, argues that the very temporal structure of trauma requires us not only to rethink the importance of Freudian theory but also to rethink the mission of psychoanalysis as a political project of bearing witness to those narratives prohibited from entering normative discourse. Here, we encounter again the traumatic silence of politically motivated violence and the affectivity of repressed histories, to which Wallace's article pointed.The closing piece in this issue turns to the pressing question of philosophical pedagogy and to its performative, affective, and plural dimensions. Samir Haddad's “Pedagogy and Plurality in the Work of Michèle Le Dœuff” takes up Le Dœuff's diagnosis of philosophy's exclusionary practices toward women, practices grounded in the philosophical imaginary and the way it structures desire. To transform the imaginary, for Le Dœuff, involves the introduction of an original understanding of plurality in philosophy. But, as Haddad shows, Le Dœuff does not address the question of how philosophy thus transformed should be taught. Haddad's tentative response proceeds through affect—specifically, the affective charge of Le Dœuff's own work; he proposes that the infectious joy of her texts be used to reorient philosophical and pedagogical practice.This affectively rich and pluralized philosophy recalls Cassin's pluralism, with which this issue begins, the critical and inclusionary politics to which the issue aims to contribute, and the textured affective field to which many of the articles gesture. The contributions collected here show the plural, imbricated, and deep trajectories of current work in Continental philosophy, its thinking in movement.",Epistemology | Existentialism | Linguistics | Openness to experience | Performative utterance | Philosophy | Plural | Psychology | Social psychology | Sociology,https://openalex.org/W4249177157,0.0,,OpenAlex,102

Poststructuralism has in fact initiated a radical reconsideration of the traditional topoi of translation theory. Largely through commentaries on Walter Benjamin's essay 'The Task of the Translator,' poststructuralist thinkers like Jacques Derrida and Paul de Man explode the binary opposition between 'original' and 'translation' which underwrites the translator's invisibility. Alternative translation practices that can effect such a deterritorialization have been appearing in the wake of poststructuralist textual theory.

Je m'en suis rendu compte lorsqu'un de mes anciens professeurs aux États-Unis, spécialiste de Proust et Céline, a récemment constaté, comme une évidence, sa place indiscutable parmi les écrivains. Pourtant, en 1992, quand sortait Tous les matins du monde, ou même à la fin des années quatre-vingt-dix, peu d'universitaires prêtaient attention à cette œuvre paradoxale qui se niait en tant que telle, alors qu'elle se tissait de livre en livre, chacun aussi époustouflant que le précédent. Quignard, qui écrit depuis 1968, est devenu, en l'espace des vingt dernières années, l'un des auteurs vivants les plus unanimement reconnus de la littérature d'expression française. L'exégèse de l'œuvre a connu plusieurs phases. Jusque vers 1990, rares étaient les analystes qui, comme Jean-Pierre Richard, pressentaient son ampleur. Cela changea après Tous les matins du monde, porté à l'écran avec grand succès, et après que Quignard publia une série de livres de portée à la fois philosophique, anthropologique, contemplative et poétique, repensant la littérature et les arts : Le Sexe et l'effroi (1994), Rhétorique spéculative (1995), La Nuit et le silence (1995), La Haine de la musique (1996), et Vie secrète (1998). L'étude de Bruno Blanckeman1, (2000), la monographie de Chantal Lapeyre-Desmaison accompagnée d'un livre d'entretiens avec l'auteur2, ouvrirent la deuxième phase exégétique, laquelle s'intéressa à repérer les grandes topiques, à situer Quignard dans le paysage de la littérature moderne, et à indiquer ses parentés les plus visibles, à commencer par la pensée structuraliste et poststructuraliste. Depuis quelques années se développe une troisième phase, où les analystes poussent plus loin la documentation des sources et influences, et précisent à quel point Quignard dialogue d'une part avec la pensée récente (Blanchot, Bataille, Lacan, Lévi-Strauss, etc.), et d'autre part est imprégné d'auteurs classiques et anciens, surtout grecs et latins (les travaux de Bénédicte Gorillot sont un exemple de cartographie de l'ancrage antique). L'étude de Bernard Vouilloux3, dont un compte-rendu est offert dans ce volume, sur le statut de l'image chez Quignard, constitue un apport notable parce qu'elle combine les aspects contemporain et antique. Avec ce présent numéro nous avons voulu montrer trois choses. D'abord que l'exégèse s'approfondit du côté des sources moins aisément décelables. Ainsi, l'essai de Camilo Bogoya identifie les écrits du sénateur romain Symmaque comme source occultée des Tablettes de buis d'Apronenia Avitia ; celui [End Page 1] de Bénédicte Gorillot redéfinit la notion de « roman latin » invoquée par Quignard ; celui de Cristina Álvares documente le dialogue implicite de la pensée de Quignard avec celle de René Girard ; Quignard lui-même confie à Chrystelle Claude comment sont nés ses personnages latins. Ensuite nous avons tenu à enrichir l'exégèse des livres récents ou peu encore analysés : les essais de Bruno Thibault sur Villa Amalia, de Chantal Lapeyre-Desmaison sur La Nuit sexuelle, d'Agnès Cousin examinant les ouvrages sur la peinture (y compris les collaborations avec des peintres), de Gaspard Turin sur l'humour dans Dernier Royaume, élargissent les perspectives critiques. Enfin ce numéro confirme qu'il existe désormais une active exégèse nord-américaine : avec l'essai de Bruno Thibault, la contribution de John Hamilton sur l'aoriste comme aspect vital de l'écriture, celle de Joseph Acquisto situant l'approche du silence dans la lignée de la modernité avant-gardiste, et celle de Daniel Larangé abordant la vaste question théologique chez un auteur qui se déclare athée, témoignent que Quignard est aussi désormais un « classique » contemporain de ce côté de l'Atlantique.

But what is the fragment, and what may be said to be its literary, philosophical, and political significance? Few writers have explored these questions with such probing radicality and rigorous tenacity as the French writer and thinker Maurice Blanchot.

For the first time in any language, this book explores in detail Blanchot’s own writing in fragments in order to understand the stakes of the fragmentary within philosophical and literary modernity. It attends in detail to each of Blanchot’s fragmentary works (Awaiting Forgetting, The Step Not Beyond, and The Writing of the Disaster) and reconstructs Blanchot’s radical critical engagement with the philosophical and literary tradition, in particular with Hegel, Nietzsche, Heidegger, Heraclitus, Levinas, Derrida, Nancy, Mallarme, Char, and others, and assesses Blanchot’s account of politics, Jewish thought, and the Shoah, with a view to understanding the stakes of fragmentary writing in Blanchot and within philosophical and literary modernity in general.",Modernity | Literature | Philosophy | Postmodernism | Politics | Hegelianism | Romance | Art | Epistemology | Political science | Law,https://openalex.org/W1581989677,71.0,,OpenAlex,19

As a term coined by Jacques Derrida, citationality involves the problematization of questions related to borders and limits and to the attempt to re-present the originary event thought to lie beyond the performance of citational acts of bearing witness. In chapter one I situate my project theoretically through an examination of the principles of deconstruction. In particular, Jacques Derrida's work on the metaphysical concepts of presence and speech, in terms of repeatability or iterability, bears heavily on my study. As a function of iterability, citationality refers to the potential inherent in every element, textual, linguistic, or otherwise, to be disseminated and cited in a plurality of contexts and to assume a new and different meaning. It is from this perspective, from the possibility of citation, of exceeding limits and escaping regulation, that I conduct my analysis of what I call ""hearsay,"" ""testimony"" and ""conference"" in certain twentieth century texts. Chapters two through four focus on an application of the previously mentioned modes of citationality in the texts of Marguerite Duras, Maurice Blanchot and Jacques Derrida, respectively. In chapter two, I examine Marguerite Duras' Lol V. Stein cycle in which a reliance on hearsay impedes textual closure while generating a multiplicity of other texts that cite and re-cite one another. In chapter three, I analyze several recits by Maurice Blanchot in terms of testimony. These texts reveal the problematic in attempting to access and re-present that which has already been present and result in an effect of mise-en-abime of citations. Chapter four involves a reading of several polylogues by Jacques Derrida as instances of conference. Their insistence on a plurality of voices enables a deconstruction of the logos of restitution. While chapters two through four are devoted to a narrow application of a practice of citationality, chapter five marks the expansion of my topic. In this chapter, I situate previously raised questions of citationality in contemporary contexts with political and cultural implications.",Art | Biology | Deconstruction (building) | Ecology | Epistemology | Hearsay | Law | Linguistics | Literature | Meaning (existential) | Philosophy | Political science | Witness,https://openalex.org/W2767579639,0.0,,OpenAlex,19

Hartman,,2005,2005-03-01,Choice Reviews Online,,article,en,False,"One of the first French intellectuals to take systematic interest in questions of language and meaning, Maurice Blanchot (1907-2003) substantially influenced such thinkers as Deleuze, Foucault, Barthes, Levinas, and Derrida. Until recently, Blanchot's work remained largely unknown outside France, in part because of its complexity and in part because Blanchot shunned intellectual celebrity. Over the past decade, however, nearly all of Blanchot's books have been translated into English, and worldwide interest in his fiction, cultural criticism, and philosophy has increased dramatically. Kevin Hart and Geoffrey H. Hartman bring together essays by prominent scholars from range of disciplines to focus on Blanchot's diverse concerns: literature, art, community, politics, ethics, spirituality, and the Holocaust. The volume takes its title from Blanchot's idea that literature is a power of contestation: contestation of the established power, contestation of what is..., contestation of language and of the forms of literary language, finally contestation of itself as power. Tracing this concept as central theme of Blanchot's writings, and exploring its scope and ambiguity, the contributors bring this seminal, but formidably difficult, intellect into sharper focus.

Puesto que el motivo constante de la escritura de Blanchot es ante todo precisar la experiencia en que ella consiste, para analizarla ha sido necesario desvelar las lineas filosoficas sobre las que se asienta el planteamiento blanchotiano que desplazo los supuestos de la respuesta que Sartre dio a la pregunta ?que es la literatura? De la recuperacion de aspectos reiteradamente obviados de las lecturas mas bellas y justas que de Blanchot hicieron Bataille, Klossowski, Foucault, Levinas, Deleuze, Derrida, Jean-Luc Nancy y Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe, se deriva que desde que nuestro autor termino sus estudios en la Universidad de Estrasburgo, regreso a Paris y conocio al circulo de autores de la revista Acephale (muchos de ellos habian acudido a los cursos de Alexandre Kojeve), sus principales interlocutores textuales fueron la “Fenomenologia del espiritu” de Hegel, “El concepto de angustia” de Kierkegaard, “Asi hablo Zaratustra” de Nietzsche, ademas de “Ser y tiempo”, la conferencia “?Que es metafisica?” y “Kant y el problema de la metafisica” de Heidegger. A traves de estos referentes, inmensos mundos filosoficos contrapuestos en puntos muy significativos, volver a interpretar la Dialectica trascendental de la “Critica de la razon pura” de Kant permite delimitar el origen de la literatura y su implacable naturaleza metafisica. En los textos de Blanchot encontramos trazado un tortuoso examen de los fundamentos del empirismo. El relato “L’instant de ma mort” representa la culminacion de algunos aspectos de dicho examen, la figura del “temoin” problematiza rasgos centrales de la experiencia de la escritura (Derrida, “Demeure. Maurice Blanchot”). Al adentrarnos en los textos de Blanchot con estas claves filosoficas, y considerando que su escritura articula tesis centrales de las obras mencionadas, nuestra tarea es mostrar que, despues de Auschwitz, la literatura hereda el problema de la metafisica y de el extrae su razon de ser. Hemos estructurado la tesis en seis partes y en cada una de ellas hemos detallado la incansable busqueda de la esencia de la literatura que Blanchot realizo escribiendo tambien a proposito de enunciados literarios y de pasajes representativos de libros de Proust, Baudelaire, Mallarme, Andre Breton, Valery, Lautreamont, Rimbaud, Robert Antelme, Marguerite Duras, Kafka, Virginia Wolf, Joyce o Beckett, entre otros.

Thesis The manners and the effects of the Neutral. Reading Blanchot in the traces of Levinas and Derrida aims at exploring the meaning and uses of a key concept in Maurice Blanchot's theoretical writings: the neutral, a notion difficult to seize and seldom discussed in recent literary theory. In Blanchot's view, the neutral is the fundamental ontological condition of literature, but to analyze his way of understanding it is a challenging task, since the neutral is impossible to tackle by means of a dialectic approach. In these circumstances, a direct conceptual analysis cannot but fail, and that is why I opted for a methodological reduction which enabled me to consider the neutral from an oblique perspective. The primary question my thesis tries to answer is therefore not is the neutral?, but does the neutral do? (i. E. What are the effects it produces), and how (in what manner it acts). From my point of view, this strategy creates a double critical distance: on the one hand, the diverse consequences the neutral had in the field of post-war French literature and philosophy notwithstanding, it allows me to deal with Blanchot's writing, that is with the rhetoric it is based upon in both his fiction and his essays; on the other hand, my analysis of the place and reception of such a notion in Levinas' and Derrida's works allows me to understand and stress out the fold that critical insight, conceptual detachment and writing create in their thought, given their complex relationship with Blanchot's oeuvre.",Philosophy | Epistemology | Reading (process) | Meaning (existential) | Dialectic | Perspective (graphical) | Literature | Humanities | Linguistics | Art | Visual arts,https://openalex.org/W13709258,0.0,,OpenAlex,18

In each instance Holland brings to bear an unrivalled depth of knowledge of Blanchot's work, matched by few, if any other commentators. Constant throughout is a sustained if at times tortuous awareness of the challenges to reading posed by Blanchot's work, in response to which Holland deploys a thought-provoking account of the writer's reworking of such intertexts as John of the Cross, Goethe, Jean Paul, Nietzsche, Breton, Woolf, and Heidegger. Crucial to Holland's presentation, too, is an uncompromising insistence on what he describes as an irreducible suspension, hiatus, or interruption, inseparable from Blanchot's thinking of literature, a vacancy of reflection that calls for interminable critical reflection in its turn, thereby opening up what Holland calls ‘une nouvelle époque de la pensée’ (p. 82). His book also appears at a time when Blanchot's writing is once more under attack: not, as in the past, from North American critics keen to discredit Derridean deconstruction in some of its more conspicuous endorsements (by alleging, with little evidence, that Blanchot in the 1930s was an egregious cryptofascist and antisemite), but, more recently, from a coterie of Parisian polemicists more interested in striking attitudes than in developing any informed understanding. It is a sad indictment of the state of intellectual debate in France that reception of Blanchot has latterly been dominated by the self-serving distortions and crude simplifications of Michel Surya (L'Autre Blanchot: l'écriture de jour, l'écriture de nuit (Paris: Gallimard, 2015)) or the platitudinous schoolboy inanities of Henri de Monvallier and Nicolas Rousseau (Blanchot l'obscur, ou, La déraison littéraire (Paris: Autrement, 2015)). Blanchot is also, one should add, the subject of a singularly myopic book by Jean-Luc Nancy (La Communauté désavouée (Paris: Galilée, 2014)), more a belated settling of accounts than a rigorous assessment of Blanchot's political thinking. Turning to Holland's nuanced, if sometimes convoluted essays alongside these reductive diatribes is to be reminded that reading Blanchot — the greatest writer of the twentieth century alongside Proust, according to Cixous — requires unremitting sobriety and critical scruple, rigorous respect for the historical archive, and a sophisticated grasp of the radical stakes of Blanchot's work. Admittedly, some may find Holland's findings overly speculative, and that his taste for hyperbole or overstatement on occasion generates more perplexity than enlightenment. It is one of the book's strengths, however, that it raises as many questions as it provides answers. Either way, it is compelling proof, as Derrida famously put it, that Blanchot still awaits us, ‘encore à venir, à lire, à relire par ceux-là mêmes qui le font depuis qu'ils savent lire — grâce à lui’ (Parages (Paris: Galilée, 2003), p. 51).",Aesthetics | Art | Biology | Deconstruction (building) | Ecology | Face (sociological concept) | Law | Linguistics | Literature | Period (music) | Philosophy | Political science | Politics | Psychoanalysis | Psychology | Reading (process),https://openalex.org/W2222487479,3.0,,"Crossref, OpenAlex",18

This essay engages with the temporal repercussions—a radical “time out of joint”—that the event of near-death opens up. It explores how Maurice Blanchot (in The Instant of My Death) and Don DeLillo (in Falling Man) attempt to write the instance of remaining through the creative use and transgressive play of language and grapple with the radical uncertainty of surviving death. Keywords: survivalnear-death narrativesDeLilloBlanchottemporality Notes 1For Derrida, the secret makes one tremble in that it unsettles everything so as “to imprint upon the body an irrepressible shaking” (The Gift of Death 53). The secret is what ties an irrefutable past (the shock of the event has affected us) with a future that cannot be anticipated, with a future that can only be apprehended as unforeseeable and unpredictable. We tremble because we do not know from which direction the shock of the secret has come, which we can neither see nor foresee: “I tremble at what exceeds my seeing and my knowing (mon voir et mon savoir) although it concerns the innermost parts of me, right down to my soul, down to the bone, as we say” (54). 2John Caputo puts this rather differently when he points out how non-knowing (non-savoir) does not imply that one relinquishes the endeavor to know or that one promotes an obscurantism that takes delight in non-knowledge. Instead, non-knowledge is what protects the future and keeps it open by keeping its secret. It breaks open the parameters of the possible by refusing knowledge that forecloses the possible scope of the future via a prescient programming or predelineation of the future's foreseeable range. 3The notion of life death (la vie la mort) is taken from Gaston's reading of Derrida in Derrida and Disinterest. It suggests that which exceeds the inversions of either life as death or death as life by creating a gap of altering difference and a structure of alteration without opposition so that life continues elsewhere.",Aesthetics | Art | Epistemology | Event (particle physics) | History | Instant | Literature | Philosophy | Physics | Psychoanalysis | Psychology | Quantum mechanics | Soul | Temporality,https://openalex.org/W2001158790,2.0,,OpenAlex,17
,Maurice Blanchot: three terrors,Marty Hiatt,,2018,2018-01-01,,,dissertation,en,,"This thesis studies the political and critical writings of Maurice Blanchot from 1933 to 1949, a period in which he underwent a number of fundamental intellectual changes that were most famously but not only political. Its overarching trope is that of the terror, which appears in three very different guises, in 1936, 1941, and 1947, playing a central role in Blanchot’s engagement each time. The terror is one of the major metaphorical complexes of twentieth century French letters. It is essentially a nested series of discourses (and medical and juridical metaphors) about how discourse connects to reality or only to itself, which makes it essentially reflexive, as well as immediately political, literary and philosophical. In it the twin heritages of revolution and Romanticism are repeatedly struggled over and re-worked into their modern forms.

My thesis elaborates Blanchot’s reckonings with this complex as a means to demonstrating the precise nature of his various changes. The goal is not to explain his political ‘turn’ but to specify the categorical modifications to his thinking that it presupposes. I trace the increasing sophistication of Blanchot’s political and literary thinking, arguing that initially Blanchot’s national revolutionary politics are formally anti-Semitic in that the prerequisite for national restoration is the violent expurgation of what is foreign. It is only with his encounter with thinkers like Jean Paulhan and Brice Parain in the 1940s that he develops an account of how terror and rhetoric, or destruction and articulation, mediate but do not limit one another, and begins to conceive of literature as the sovereign creation-destruction of realities via their interaction. It is his encounter with Hegel that enables him to re-link this conception to history by arguing that it directly corresponds to revolution, a view founded on Hegel’s basic homology between language and history. 

I argue that Blanchot’s identification of himself with revolution, as well as his negative reading of Hegel (his refusal of ‘achieved’ sense and development generally), sets a kind of absolute positioning named ‘ambiguity’ from which Blanchot will endeavour to think henceforth: it leads directly to his tendency to proceed by the unfolding of paradoxes and to the inescapably plural meaning of his 1950s (anti-)categories such as the neuter. It also precludes the possibility of a fixed division between literature and the political, which I argue is sufficient grounds for ruling out modelling his turn on a transition from one to the other. Such a reading, which is more explicitly materialist than most of those proposed to date, provides a different basis from which to approach Blanchot’s celebrated 1950s critical writings: namely, that they are suffused with the absolute experience of the identity with literature and revolution that Blanchot ‘becomes’ in the late 1940s. It also implies that Blanchot was preoccupied with thinking the link between literature and history throughout his career, and that even the rarefied nature of some of his writings is due to this very issue and his responses to it, rather than to his indifference to such a link.",Trope (literature) | Politics | Literature | Rhetorical question | Rhetoric | Philosophy | Political radicalism | TRACE (psycholinguistics) | Aesthetics | Epistemology | Art | Political science | Law | Linguistics,https://openalex.org/W3009749245,0.0,,OpenAlex,17

Celebre pamphlet formule par Rene Etiemble en 1963, qui fait date, aujourd’hui encore dans toute tentative de comparabilite poetique. La presente these essaie d’aller au-dela de cette prescription theorique, sans toutefois perdre de vue la mesure et la pertinence qui la supposent. Maurice Blanchot et Leopold Sedar Senghor. Deux auteurs que tout semble eloigner. Le premier, Europeen de culture, a produit une œuvre marquee par la distance heuristique, le desœuvrement infini et la discretion interminable d’un sujet qui va disparaissant. Le second, Africain et academicien a ecrit des recueils de poemes et des essais sur le Socialisme et l’Esthetique negro-africaine. Rien ne presageait une quelconque rencontre entre ces deux ecrivains. Ils ont cependant en commun la poetique de la Nuit, espace d’expression thematique qui structure ce travail. Blanchot et Senghor sont distants a l’egard des modes traditionnels de la Raison. L’un a ecrit des fictions fragmentaires, des recits marques par des apophtegmes ainsi que des textes critiques iconoclastes. L’autre a jete un soupcon radical sur la Raison discursive et la pensee geometrique. La Nuit est le lieu de ces renversements hermeneutiques. A partir d’une approche ouverte, la these procede a la reevaluation des outils classiques de lisibilite des textes litteraires, en tentant de repondre a trois questions cardinales : Pourquoi et Comment la Nuit chez Blanchot et Senghor ? Quelles sont donc les discontinuites qui s’etendent dans cette region obscure et etrange ? Mais encore, Comment surmonter l’absence d’echanges effectifs, pour approcher le debat ainsi manque chez ces deux auteurs ? Telles sont les apories principales qui gouvernent cette recherche. Pour s’y risquer, une poetique transversale est convoquee : les Psychanalyses litteraires, pour saisir les frustrations initiales qui se metamorphosent dans le Jour et fondent le texte dans la Nuit. La Mythocritique et son dispositif triangulaire, pour observer les rapports entre le heros mythique, le personnage romanesque (ou poetique) et l’ecrivain. Et enfin, la Deconstruction, pour suivre le receptacle theorique qui est le point de condensation de ces dissymetries. La Nuit apparait alors comme une operation de demantelement des institutions du Savoir, qui etire la parole litteraire jusqu’a l’abolition radicale des differences : inaccessibilite de l’Alterite chez Blanchot, heterogeneite du rythme intuitif, l’Autre de la raison chez Senghor.",Humanities | Art | Philosophy,https://openalex.org/W601541293,0.0,,OpenAlex,17

Sobrepasando el legado de la tradicion, la formulacion blanchotiana de (lo) Neutro es justamente la marca de lo que no es apropiable, figurando en nuestro trabajo exactamente como la denominacion de un limite. Punto de fuga frente a la organizacion convencional de la subjetividad y del sentido, asi como de toda razon, la escritura de Blanchot es entendida en estas paginas como una afirmacion de la alteridad, en el mismo movimiento en que traza una nueva cartografia del espacio literario, en un pensamiento de la imagen, del texto, de la lectura, asi como de la totalidad de la experiencia. Ademas incidiremos en la relacion entre escritura y politica, subrayandose la contribucion de Blanchot a las formulaciones del compromiso literario, la responsabilidad, la comunidad y la democracia. Pensando originalmente autores como Sade, Kafka, Kierkegaard o Duras, la escritura de Blanchot opera un desoeuvrement de lo comunitario, al hilo de una lectura declarada de Jean-Luc Nancy y con la influencia implicita del trabajo de Jacques Derrida, que es tambien objecto de atencion en esta tesis. Siguiendo a estos autores, indagaremos en una politica pensada como cuidado para con el Otro, cuya exterioridad no es reductible a un lugar, una frontera o un limite. Se pretende encontrar, en Blanchot y escuchando a otros pensadores contemporaneos, una desconstruccion del lexico comunitario, asi como de los discursos tradicionales del poder, aqui y ahora puestos en causa por la experiencia de la escritura. La comunidad, pensada como alteridad infinita, pone en escena los limites de lo comun, como tal, y una nueva manera de entender lo comunitario.",Humanities | Philosophy | Art,https://openalex.org/W2732324512,0.0,,OpenAlex,17
,Maurice Blanchot : art and technology,Holly Langstaff,,2017,2017-09-01,,,dissertation,en,,"Maurice Blanchot (1907-2003), writer of fiction, literary critic, political journalist and thinker, is one of the most influential figures in twentieth-century literature and thought. The relationship between art and technology is a largely unexplored aspect of Blanchot’s writing; this thesis examines his engagement with the question of techne in criticism and fiction over a fifty-year period and demonstrates that he is far from subscribing to the technophobia of probably the most influential thinker of technology, Martin Heidegger. It is argued that writing for Blanchot is a mode of techne which destabilises the opposition between nature and culture, or nature and technology, or nature and history, and provides a means of thinking other than the anthropos. The chronological approach of this thesis stresses how a thinking of writing as techne radicalises over time and indicates the enduring influence of Blanchot.

The first chapter considers the treatment of the division, often taken for granted by critics, between literary and everyday language; focussing on Blanchot’s reading of Mallarme in essays dating from 1940 to 1952, this chapter reveals a shift in his thinking of literature from autonomy to radical non-essentiality. The second chapter examines Blanchot’s critical engagement with Heidegger in essays written in 1953 and shows how we might reconcile Blanchot’s work with ecological thought. A third chapter focuses on the discussion of modern technologies in essays from the 1950s and 1960s and the coincidental emergence of the non-concept of the neuter in literature and criticism; it listens to various apocalyptic tones in work from this period to reveal a continuity between the experience of the technological and of the imaginary. The final chapter explores how ‘technique’ is everywhere implied once the term disappears from Blanchot’s idiom; it argues that fragmentary writing is that techne which outplays the human.",Techne | Criticism | Opposition (politics) | Literature | Literary criticism | Politics | Autonomy | Philosophy | Epistemology | Art | Political science | Law,https://openalex.org/W2884898586,0.0,,OpenAlex,17

Shortly after World War II, Levinas introduced the concept of il y a as a critique of Heidegger’s notion of ‘es gibt’ and in direct reference to Blanchot’s first novel, Thomas l’Obscur.1 In Literature and the Right to Death (1947), Blanchot acknowledged the importance of this notion in a footnote dedicated to Levinas’s publication of De l’existence a l’existant.2 For both of them, contrary to the Heideggerian understanding of being related to the fear of death, the il y a expresses the ‘simple facticity of being riveted to existence without an exit’, as Simon Critchley summarizes in his book on literature and philosophy.3 More recently, William Large has shown how the concept of the il y a derives from the renewal of ontology in Heidegger’s Being and Time by pointing to the impersonal characteristic of moods as implied in the description of the il y a.4 Nevertheless, from the start the il y a is also the site of an important difference between Blanchot and Levinas that is not fully expressed by the cross-references of the two authors.

By building its methodological foundations on the overlapping concepts of origin, image, absence, and the Other in the astrophysical and literary realms, this analytical study is to discuss how irreducible alterity of the spacetime dimensions is sustained in Blanchotian temporality of writing so as to enunciate a moment of fascination in relation with the Other and its mystery. This is where Levinas's formulation for the corrolation of time with the Other converges and anastomoses astrophysical phenomenon of quantum entanglement. How Blanchot's temporalization of writing subsists on a narrative temporality of everyday on the one hand and how it is simultaneously entangled with a diachronous extraordinary exteriority delineates where fascination reigns for Blanchot at a big crunch singularity of ethics. What Blanchot is to bring to the fore is to quantize in the space of literature such that our everyday experience of life and spacetime is definitely entangled with another unexperienced and singular spacetime whose effects on us and vice versa are not deniable.

We might be tempted to look for correspondences to his writings on literature and philosophy or for ways in which his narratives conform to the genre of the philosophical novel, but these strategies raise as many questions as they might answer. Do Blanchot’s narratives enact ways of thinking found in such essays as “La littérature et le droit à la mort” (1947–48)? Can we extract a philosophical program linked to the philosophers Blanchot often invokes or responds to: Hegel, Nietzsche, Husserl, Heidegger, and Levinas? Part of the difficulty in addressing the question of philosophy in Blanchot’s narratives is narrative itself: characters and their relations, sequences of events, and narrative voice, all of which Blanchot pushes to an extreme limit that renders standard narrative categories radically unstable. The authors of the essays in Clandestine Encounters are acutely aware of these difficulties, producing rigorously argued readings of all of Blanchot’s narratives.Editor Kevin Hart, author of The Dark Gaze: Maurice Blanchot and the Sacred (2004) and coeditor with Geoffrey Hartman of The Power of Contestation: Perspectives on Maurice Blanchot (2005), provides in his introduction an overview of central notions crucial to reading Blanchot’s narratives. Hart points out that Blanchot “prefers to talk, he says, of the ‘philosophical’ rather than of ‘philosophy,’” of a radical questioning that undermines rather than upholds the tradition of philosophy associated with proper names (3). The “philosophical” as endless questioning, which Hart argues is related to Blanchot’s interest in ancient skepticism, opens up the possibility of approaching the “murmur” of what is other to philosophical discourse, the murmur of “the Outside” (or as he sometimes calls it, the “Neutral” or the “Imaginary”; 10). The twelve essays in this collection attend to the ways in which philosophy is haunted by the Outside in Blanchot’s narratives and explore his use of an uncanny narrative voice and fragmentary narrative forms in order to make its murmur heard.The collection is organized in chronological order, and each essay focuses on a specific work. The first, by Vivian Liska and Arthur Cools, examines Blanchot’s earliest récits, “Le dernier mot” (1935) and “L’idylle” (1936), which were republished together in 1951 as Le ressassement éternel. Liska and Cools read these early narratives for signs of Blanchot’s later poetics, arguing that while “L’idylle” has a “largely traditional and realistic narrative mode,” “Le dernier mot” “points…toward a radical transformation of the literary space altogether” (49). They note that the 1951 publication printed the stories in reverse chronological order and suggest that there is a narrative logic to this placement: while written earlier, “Le dernier mot” acts to counter “L’idylle”’s more closed narrative and opens out to the possibility of a beyond. Both récits concern a narrator living under a totalitarian order, but while there is no escape in “L’idylle,” “Le dernier mot” suggests “a new world without power and authority, without judge and master, without God and narrator” (57–58). And yet, since this possibility is never realized, the “outside” pointed to “may be nothing but…a ceaseless mutter infinitely repeating itself with no escape in sight” (58).Liska and Cools show that even in his earliest narratives Blanchot is writing toward an Outside that would undermine totalizing systems of thought. Leslie Hill’s essay, “Weary Words,” presents another version of this disruption later in Blanchot’s career, as he prepared for the publication of L’entretien infini (1969). This collection of critical and philosophical essays was ready for publication in 1965, but Blanchot’s “weariness” over the project led him to delay publication and ultimately to incorporate a fragmentary dialogue into the text, a gesture that calls into question the autonomy of philosophical-critical discourse. The collection’s original working title, L’absence de livre, suggests Blanchot’s impossible project, a book that would be the absence of the book. For Hill, this impossible project can be read in the “weariness” that runs throughout its text, from the récit that interrupts the philosophical-critical mode to the essays themselves. “Just like the tired, exhausted volume to which it belongs,” Hill writes, “[weariness] is a passage to the limit and an exposure to what exceeds the limit. It is that to which philosophy, thought, knowledge, work, writing, all must tend as their only, sufficient end; but it is also what mocks and defeats the possibility of all sufficiency” (295).These two essays focus on the ways in which Blanchot’s narratives question the very possibility of philosophy. Other essays in the collection focus on the encounter between Blanchot’s narratives and one or more philosophical traditions, most notably phenomenology. Kevin Hart, in his own contribution to the collection, traces the meanings of the word “obscure” and the theme of the double in Blanchot’s Thomas l’obscur (both the roman [1941] and the récit [1950] versions) through philosophy and literature—Heraclitus, Heidegger, Mallarmé, Thomas Hardy, and others—to arrive at a version of the phenomenological reduction that Hart calls “the neutral reduction.” While the phenomenological reduction reveals human being as “being-in-relation,” the split within the character of Thomas between a man who feels himself dead even while living and an “obscure,” “neutral” Thomas “falls outside of relationship”: the obscure Thomas’s “phenomenality can be experienced as a strangeness, but he cannot be brought into the light of intelligibility. He cannot become a phenomenon and must remain haunting the Thomas whose aching, relentless voice we hear as we read the narrative” (81–82). The neutral reduction, then, reveals being as haunted by a relation without relation to the Outside.The impossibility of relation arises again in Stephen E. Lewis’s essay, “A Law without Flesh,” which reads the erotics of Blanchot’s 1948 novel Le Très-Haut in light of Jean-Luc Marion’s phenomenological account of the love relation as the “‘giving of flesh’ between lovers” (126). Blanchot’s characters are constrained in their relations by the law, which forbids such free exchange. There is no “phenomenon of the flesh” in Blanchot, but Lewis offers Marion’s concept as a possibility for an Outside that, while foreclosed in Blanchot’s text, might resist the “dissatisfactions of the law” (144). Rodolphe Gasché also considers Blanchot’s relation to phenomenology in Celui qui ne m’accompagnait pas (1953), setting the narrator’s reflections against Husserl’s notion of phenomenological “description,” which is concerned with “how I live and experience…objects in the various intentional acts that are directed upon them” (224). This récit concerns the relation between the narrator and a “companion” who demands that the narrator describe the things of the world. Against this demand for “facts” and “transparency,” Blanchot’s text ultimately reveals that “no light, no transparency, no clarity, no evidence, and, properly speaking, no certainty any longer characterize this ‘space’ and ‘time’” (228).This demand for narration arises also in La folie du jour (1949, 1973), in what seems to the narrator to be an “authoritarian interrogation” by two doctors. “Tell us ‘just exactly’ what happened,” they say (The Station Hill Blanchot Reader, trans. Lydia Davis et al. [Barrytown, NY: Station Hill, 1999], 199). The récit ends with what Christopher Fynsk, in his essay “Writing and Sovereignty,” calls a “sovereign act of exception,” a refusal to narrate (192). But Fynsk argues that the récit contains not just a “sovereign no” but also a “sovereign yes,” an “enigmatic transcendence” (192). The relation between these two is a “neutral or interrupted one,” a step (not) beyond (le pas au-delà). Blanchot’s narrative brings together both a refusal to accede to authoritarian power and a strange “self-effacement” or “unworking freedom,” without reconciling one with the other (192). In this nonrelation, Fynsk argues, we can understand Blanchot’s writing as a “sovereign writing” (192).Blanchot’s final narrative, L’instant de ma mort (1994), returns to the problem of telling “what happened,” in this case the autobiographical event of his near execution by a Nazi firing squad in July 1944. The final essay in the collection, Thomas S. Davis’s “Neutral War,” analyzes three “voices” in Blanchot’s elusive text: “the autobiographical, the historical, [and] the literary,” which “both enable and interfere with one another” (320). The interference of these three voices results in a text that addresses the problem of narrative events “lost to history,” expressing a “fidelity to those people and experiences that are impossible to account for” (320, 321). Ultimately, Davis argues that one can locate a “concept of the political” as “pure contestation” in Blanchot’s text, which is not so much a concept, Davis admits, as “an incessant questioning” (321).Philosophy in Blanchot’s narratives is in question because Blanchot’s writing is itself a mode of questioning, a point borne out by all of the essays in the collection, including those I have not been able to address. The pleasure in reading these insightful essays lies in the careful attention to how Blanchot’s narratives pose these questions, not only of philosophy but of their own narrative procedures.

,"Récit de l’événement et événement du récit chez Annie Ernaux, Hélène Cixous et Maurice Blanchot",Elsa Laflamme,,2014,2014-05-01,,,dissertation,fr,,"Cette these porte sur trois textes autobiographiques qui questionnent, a travers l’elaboration d’une pensee de l’evenement, les oppositions convenues entre fiction et temoignage. L’Evenement (2000) d’Annie Ernaux, Le jour ou je n’etais pas la (2000) d’Helene Cixous et L’Instant de ma mort (1994) de Maurice Blanchot presentent le recit autoreferentiel d’un evenement traumatique, soit un avortement clandestin pour Ernaux, la mort en bas âge d’un enfant trisomique pour Cixous et la mise en joue par un soldat nazi lors de la Seconde Guerre mondiale pour Blanchot. Ce corpus, quoique heterogene a plusieurs egards, loge a l’enseigne d’une litterature placee sous le signe de l’aveu, de la confession et de la revelation ; cette litterature porterait au jour ce qui etait jusque-la demeure impossible a dire. Partant de la figure de la honte inscrite dans ces trois œuvres, mais aussi dans d’autres textes de ces ecrivains qui permettent de deployer ce qui se trame de secret et d’evenement dans le corpus principal, cette these a pour objectif d’analyser les deplacements et les retours d’un trauma garde secret pendant une quarantaine d’annees et qui remonte, par la voie de l’evenement, a la surface de l’ecriture. Sous la double impulsion de la pensee de Jacques Derrida et de l’approche psychanalytique, cette these s’interesse a la question de l’evenement a l’œuvre chez Ernaux, Cixous et Blanchot. Dans chacune de ces œuvres, un evenement traumatique intervient comme revelateur de l’ecriture et d’un rapport singulier a la pensee de l’evenement, marque soit historiquement et politiquement (Blanchot), soit intimement (Cixous et Ernaux). Par l’ecriture, ces auteurs tentent en effet de rendre compte de l’authenticite de l’evenement ressenti, problematisant du meme coup la nature et la fonction de l’evenement tant reel que psychique dans le recit de soi. L’evenement est ainsi aborde dans son caractere historique, psychanalytique mais egalement philosophique, ontologique ; la pensee de l’evenement mise a l’epreuve des textes d’Ernaux, de Cixous et de Blanchot permet d’explorer les figures de la date, de l’archive, de la mort et du deuil qui lui sont liees, en plus de donner lieu a une poetique singuliere chez chacun. Enfin, la these traite du rapport entre l’aveu de l’evenement et la langue qui, defiant l’opposition traditionnelle du constatif et du performatif, entraine l’evenement du recit, cet autre evenement qui arrive en meme temps que le recit de l’evenement traumatique.",Humanities | Art | Philosophy,https://openalex.org/W614551820,0.0,,OpenAlex,17

,"La exigencia de un habla plural. literatura, pensamiento y comunidad en la obra de Maurice Blanchot",Idoia Quintana Domínguez,,2013,2013-11-12,,,dissertation,es,,"Esta tesis se presenta como una aproximacion critica a la obra de Maurice Blanchot que toma como punto de partida la afirmacion de la escritura como una experiencia desestabilizadora del orden conceptual legado por la tradicion filosofica. Esta hipotesis sera desarrollada en las tres partes que componen este estudio ? literatura, pensamiento y comunidad ? con la finalidad de caracterizar y establecer las consecuencias que de ello se desprende. La obra de Maurice Blanchot muestra el desvio esencial que afecta a toda palabra: una palabra desviada de aquel que habla o escribe, y una palabra desviada de la palabra discursiva. Es decir, una palabra que pone en suspenso la presencia y la referencia ultima a la unidad. Este desvio nos permitira abordar el espacio de lo inapropiable ? la escritura, la muerte ? y de la alteridad ? autrui ? a partir del cual se dibujara la exigencia de pensar lo que pone en relacion con una ausencia esencial de relacion. Esta «relacion sin relacion» es definida como lo que permite acoger a lo otro sin caer en el gesto tradicional que se asienta en la reduccion de lo otro a lo mismo. Se vera asi como esto solo es posible desde una manera de acoger que, ante lo desconocido, lo extranjero, lo oscuro, no busca como desvelarlo o llevarlo a la luz segun la metafora optica por la que ver es sinonimo de conocer y dominar. Esta otra manera apunta hacia una forma de acoger lo oscuro en su oscuridad, en la falta de relacion que permite el movimiento infinito de una relacion nunca concluida. La obra de Blanchot propone una nueva cartografia donde la literatura, la filosofia, el espacio de la comunidad, lo politico y sus relaciones son puestos en cuestion desde su lugar y su tener lugar. Un pensamiento que tambien entabla un profundo dialogo con la filosofia y la literatura, con los clasicos, sus contemporaneos y con las generaciones posteriores de pensadores entre los cuales cabria destacar a Jacques Derrida, Jean-Luc Nancy y Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe, filosofos que han jugado un rol fundamental en este estudio de la obra de Maurice Blanchot.",Humanities | Philosophy,https://openalex.org/W25506403,1.0,,OpenAlex,17

In the third week of May, during a lull in unrest, radio broadcasts reported that Daniel Cohn-Bendit, the young German Jewish strike leader, had been denied reentry into France after a brief trip to Germany. The government decision, clearly meant to diffuse the protest, had the opposite effect. Crowds poured into the streets without directive, organization, or planning and united in the following chant: ""Nous sommes tous des Juifs allemands.""1 On one level, the function of this call amid the student riots was straightforward: it was a rallying cry, a statement of solidarity with the movement's boisterous leader. By capitalizing on the act of deportation, this slogan allowed for the easy (although obviously unfair) analogy between the French government and Nazi Germany. Thus, the phrase underscored the position of the students as victims of an oppressive and authoritative regime while simultaneously reenacting the ideal of fraternité illustrated here by the students' insistence that nothing separated their status from that of their foreign-born Jewish leader. Given this interpretation, the students' expression of solidarity could be read as a demonstration of the French republican spirit, evoking the stance of the Dreyfusards some eighty years earlier when they refused to allow one man to be condemned unjustly—except, of course, for one remarkable [End Page 522] difference:2 During the Dreyfus affair, those who rallied for the Jewish captain's cause did so in the name of the Enlightenment ideal of humanity, an ideal uniting men above and beyond their differences.3 They protested the suspicion directed at Dreyfus as a Jew and established their solidarity with him as a man and as a French citizen. As Emile Zola so famously wrote to President Faure, ""I have but one passion, that of the Enlightenment, in the name of the humanity that has suffered so much and that has a right to happiness.""4 Dreyfus's Jewish identity was nearly beside the point. The student protestors of May '68, in contrast, allied themselves with Cohn-Bendit by adopting his identity, not by asserting that he shared in theirs. They did not protest in the name of an idea of humanity but in the name of ""the Jew""; instead of claiming the status of the universal for Cohn-Bendit, they claimed the status of exception, of Jewish particularity, for themselves.5 In what follows I will be considering two interpretations of this event and its significance for thinking about the status of the Jew and Judaism in France, one by the contemporary philosopher and cultural critic Alain Finkielkraut (b. 1949) and the other by the writer and critic Maurice Blanchot (1907–2003).6 Despite the differences in these two interpretations, [End Page 523] both come to their conclusion, I will argue, by way of Emmanuel Levinas's (1906–95) representation of Judaism in what have come to be called his Jewish writings. My argument is that these two interpretations, despite certain commonalities, reveal in the starkness of their opposition a tension at the heart of Levinas's conception of Judaism. For Finkielkraut, Levinas provides a means to reject the actions of the student protestors and yet simultaneously to defend Judaism as a teacher of moral autonomy in line with the tradition of the Enlightenment, a true center worthy of defending from the onslaught of multiculturalism. For Blanchot, on the contrary, the protestors' actions enact the political principles inherent in Judaism. In the very impropriety of their actions they perform an act of uprooting, the inspiration for which Blanchot discovers in Levinas's philosophy. In what follows, I will first trace the architecture of Finkielkraut's and Blanchot's position, contextualizing their reactions to the slogan within the larger framework of their thought. I will then turn to Levinas in order to illustrate how their positions on...",Aesthetics | Archaeology | Art | German | History | Identity (music) | Judaism | Law | Literature | Nazism | Philosophy | Political science | Politics | Politics of memory | Religious studies | Solidarity | The Holocaust | Theology,https://openalex.org/W2011704170,2.0,,OpenAlex,17

This is all the more surprising given Husserl’s puzzling claim in the 1905 lectures that a “prophetic consciousness is conceivable.” In that regard, Maurice Blanchot’s conception of the “disaster,” which he defines as “that which does not answer to any expectation,” helps problematize the presuppositions of the phenomenology of anticipation. In Blanchot’s work, the event is not to be thought of as deception, surprise, rupture or excess, all notions that are still negatively bound to an underlying and unquestioned stance of expectation. This not only seems to distinguish Blanchot’s position from the negative eschatologies of Emmanuel Levinas, Gershom Scholem, Jacques Derrida, and others. It also implies that the disaster would be beyond experience and even beyond conceivability, since the “delay of the event” would turn out to define the inherited structure of our experience of time. By linking The Writing of the Disaster with Awaiting Oblivion and “A Change of Epoch,” the paper will argue that Husserl’s conception of expectation bears traces of an implicit prophetic paradigm and that the affectivity of protention might be a product of an institution that is both originary and historical.

This demand was later formulated by Jean‐Luc Nancy and Philippe Lacoue‐Labarthe as the philosophical interrogation of the political (le politique), in distinction from the question of politics (la politique). This essay begins by arguing that what is at stake in this distinction is the very possibility of politics that is otherwise foreclosed. It then explores Nancy’s interrogation of le politique in The Inoperative Community, and compares his response to Maurice Blanchot’s response in The Unavowable Community. It is argued that both deconstructions of “community” depict a certain sociality that corresponds to Derrida’s call—a “communality” beyond or radically other than the traditional model of community as formed by sovereign individuals and as forming the sovereign state. Where they differ is that Blanchot founds the ethical relation of the “unavowable” community on the radical interruption of ontology signaled by death, whereas Nancy casts ontology itself in an ethical register, and thereby allows a certain solidarity to emerge as well. At the very moment when there is no longer a “command post” from which a “socialist vision” could put forward a subject of history or politics, or, in an even broader sense, when there is no longer a “city” or “society” out of which a regulative figure could be modeled, at this moment being‐many, shielded from all intuition, from all representation or imagination, presents itself with all the acuity of its question, with all the sovereignty of its demand (Jean‐Luc Nancy 2000 Nancy, Jean‐Luc. 2000.

,"Radical Indecision: Barthes, Blanchot, Derrida, and the Future of Criticism",Leslie Hill,,2010,2010-01-15,,,book,en,,"In his newest book, Radical Indecision, esteemed scholar Leslie Hill poses the following question: If the task of a literary critic is to make decisions about the value of a literary work or the values embodied in it, decisions in turn based on some inherited or established values, what happens when that piece of literature fails to subscribe to the established values? Put another way, how should literary criticism respond to the paradox that in order to make critical judgments of literary works, it is first necessary to suspend judgment and to consider the impossibility of making a final decision? Hill pursues these ideas in the works of leading French critics Roland Barthes, Maurice Blanchot, and Jacques Derrida, discussing writers such as Sade, Mallarme, Proust, Artaud, Genet, Celan, and Duras. Hill concludes that, despite their differences, Barthes, Blanchot, and Derrida share a conviction that criticism cannot take place without exposure to that resistance to decision that is inseparable from reading and that they address diversely as the 'neuter' or the 'undecidable'. Radical Indecision offers the first sustained exploration of the 'undecidable'.

Throughout his life, Blanchot sought to minimize his status as a public figure and at times isolated himself from friends and colleagues. Blanchot’s modernism emphasizes the radical singularity of the artist’s production: the work of art completely thwarts all attempts to subsume it according to some pre-established universal category or identity. For Blanchot, écriture – art in its most indeterminate form – is an expression not of an author who actively and deliberately conceives and creates; rather, it is a reflection of an experience of radical passivity, the futile and always incomplete struggle with mortal existence. The work of art abandons the artist, the poet, the writer, to a state of permanent dislocation and exile. The nomadic nature of the artist’s experience testifies – in accentuated form – to the subject in general. Blanchot speaks famously of la communauté inavouable – the unavow-able or unworkable character of the community that is to come.

10.1353/sub.2021.0014,Introduction: Reading After Blanchot,Zakir Paul,,2021,2021-01-01,SubStance,,article,en,False,"IntroductionReading After Blanchot Zakir Paul (bio) ""Blanchot is an even greater waste of time than Proust"" (qtd. in Smock 3). George Poulet's judgment, in Ann Smock's wry translation, gives pause to anyone who might claim contemporary literary or political relevance for the French writer, critic, and journalist. Poulet writes, ""Thus, much more radically even than Proust, Maurice Blanchot appears a man of 'lost time'"" (qtd. in Smock 4).1 How does relegating him to such a forgotten past, only accessed involuntarily through missteps, square with his enduring influence over post-war French thought and narrative? Blanchot seems to reject the redemptive abilities attributed to writing from the Phaedrus to Proust. In his thinking, ""all anamnesis is radically impossible,"" all writing instead turns towards ""a time below time"" (Laporte 28). The disaster has always already occurred in some frightfully ancient past—more as a scene than an originary event—even as it remains bound up with a process of perpetual repetition. So how, if at all, does Blanchot speak to the present? Responses to this question are quickly complicated by the rich and varied reception of his work. A lifelong friend of Levinas, he had a considerable influence on Foucault, Deleuze, Derrida, Kofman, Lacoue-Labarthe, Nancy, and many others. Both his fiction and criticism played a determining role in how postwar French philosophy was written, especially in its intense concern with the question of writing as such. Never an academic, he published most of his critical writing in periodicals and led a highly private life. Yet, beginning with his controversial pre-war journalism, his writing included an often underestimated public and political dimension. When Blanchot was considered as a potential editor of the Nouvelle revue française during the occupation, Paul Claudel exclaimed, ""Who is this unknown Blanchot?"" (Bident 173). While the obscurity around his name has been dispelled by decades of commentary, what his signature evokes still remains narrowly circumscribed for many readers: beginning with the extremeright journalism and literary chronicles of the interwar years, Blanchot becomes the author of a trilogy of early novels, followed by increasingly [End Page 3] formless narratives staging scenes of absence, dying and impossible dialogue; searching critical essays exploring the space of literature; and the related effects of writing, disaster, exile, and an ethical attunement to the foreign and the other. Yet this very sequence of associations often limits the appeal, or indeed the legibility, of Blanchot beyond a world of experts familiar with his references from Heraclites, Hölderlin, and Nietzsche to Mallarmé, Bataille, and Duras. For many readers, Claudel's exasperation continues to echo. Whether this obscurity can be entirely dispelled is another matter.2 From De Man onwards, readers have noted both the clarity of Blanchot's style and the obscurity his readings cast on texts (de Man 63). Lydia Davis characterizes the challenge for his translators as finding ""an equivalent of Blanchot's limpid obscurity"" (504). Fredric Jameson remarks that ""the luminous and light-filled clearing promised by Heideggerian ontology and poetics has here become as dark and ominous as a black hole"" (72). The entirety of literature and philosophy risks disappearing into this black hole, whose singularity promises a new concept of literature. Jameson's retelling of Blanchot's ""long and complicated career"" as a distinctly French ""ideology of modernism"" or ""ideology of aesthetic autonomy"" is worth recalling here. Blanchot moves from being a right-wing ideologist in the 1930s to a novelist whose Kafkaesque forms exhaust themselves into reflections on the ""pure act of writing"" in order to emerge as the ""quintessential literary theorist of poststructuralist textuality."" This metamorphosis occurs in what Jameson calls the ""fallow period""—which he polemically dubs the end of Blanchot's ""fascist commitment and the onset of the great wars of national independence"" (184). By simultaneously expanding the classically French canon of texts he previously read and reviewed to include the ""foreign""—whether newly translated American and English writers, or revalorized German language figures—and reducing this heterogenous body of work to the ""paradox of literary writing"" or the autonomy of art, Blanchot replaces the language of schools and movements proper to French criticism with the modernist ideology of aesthetic...",Aesthetics | Art | History | Law | Linguistics | Literature | Narrative | Philosophy | Political science | Politics | Reading (process),https://openalex.org/W3194981550,1.0,,OpenAlex,16

On the one hand, his rigorous yet always-playful exchanges with the most challenging figures of the philosophical and literary canons of modernity have led thinkers such as Georges Bataille, Emmanuel Levinas, Jacques Derrida, and Michel Foucault to acknowledge Blanchot as a major influence on the development of literary and philosophical culture after World War II. On the other hand, Blanchot’s reputation for frustrating readers with his difficult style of thought and writing has resulted in a missed opportunity for leveraging Blanchot in advancing the most essential discussions and debates going on today in the comparative study of literature, philosophy, politics, history, ethics, and art. Blanchot’s voice is simply too profound, too erudite, and too illuminating of what is at stake at the intersections of these disciplines not to be exercising more of an influence than it has in only a minority of intellectual circles.",Aesthetics | Art | Continental philosophy | Epistemology | Law | Literature | Modernism (music) | Modernity | Philosophy | Political science | Politics | Style (visual arts),https://openalex.org/W4253799531,3.0,,"Crossref, OpenAlex",16
,A impossibilidade de morrer e a desconstrução da morte: Blanchot e Derrida,Jerônimo de Camargo Milone,,2015,2015-03-30,,,dissertation,pt,,"Esta dissertacao trata de elencar subsidios para uma interpretacao a respeito da morte na obras de Maurice Blanchot e Jacques Derrida. Os pontos de pertinencia em cuja tese se desdobra sao os seguintes.
Primeiramente, a pertinencia da morte dentro do pensamento blanchotiano, destacando suas relacoes ao pensamento de Hegel, Heidegger e Bataille, abordando, principalmente, “La litterature et le droit a la mort”. Neste sentido, a dissertacao trata de apresentar argumentos que demonstram uma separacao de Blanchot as interpretacoes sobre a morte nos autores citados, inserindo sua pertinencia maior na discussao com Derrida e, de certo modo, com Levinas – perspectiva tomada, sobretudo, de L’entretien infini e L’ecriture du desastre.
Em seguida apresenta-se, detidamente em Derrida, a crucialidade da morte para o desenvolvimento em sentido lato do pensamento derridiano e da desconstrucao. Assim, trata-se de destacar os argumentos derridianos, em setores parcialmente diversos da sua obra, para evidenciar a estreita ligacao da desconstrucao com uma critica da morte e da apreensao filosofica do pensamento da morte como atributo arquetipo de uma sensificacao que legitima o discurso conceitual. Neste ponto, a preocupacao do trabalho e fazer surgir a importância, quase que axiomatica, de uma critica do uso da morte para o movimento da desconstrucao, apresentando, portanto, a partir de Le Seminaire La peine de Mort, a desconstrucao da morte como um aspecto de extrema relevância no amplo pensamento de Derrida.
Finalmente, a dissertacao trata de fazer convergir e evidenciar a intimidade da relacao entre os pensamentos de Derrida e Blanchot, na sua similar orientacao aporetica, que insiste na irredutibilidade da morte ao trabalho do pensamento, como elemento essencial – alem e aquem da essencia - da alteridade. Assim, a impossibilidade de morrer, como denuncia do movimento dialetico, seria analoga a desconstrucao da morte enquanto critica da legitimacao da verdade a partir de uma determinada apreensao da morte.
Diagonalmente a tais conceitos, a dissertacao insiste sob os caracteres da poesia e da alteridade, expressando a implicabilidade desta questao aos pensamentos etico e estetico como formas de um testemunho incomensuravel as tentativas de circunscricao da vida.",Humanities | Philosophy,https://openalex.org/W2191323829,0.0,,OpenAlex,16
10.1093/fs/knt235,Maurice Blanchot and Fragmentary Writing: A Change of Epoch,Edward Brennan,,2014,2014-01-01,French Studies,Liverpool University Press,article,en,False,"The fragmentary interrupts continuity and contests authority. While it is often conceived as a negation, apophatic in that it can only be defined as what it is not, fragmentary writing for Blanchot exceeds all negation or negativity. In contrast to Adorno and modernist temptations to subordinate fragmentary writing to the unified artwork and dialectic of realization, Leslie Hill describes Blanchot's conception of the fragmentary as neither governed by negativity nor evocative of a lost totality. Blanchot's fragmentary is the affirmation of a spectral demand, not one mourning the ghosts of modernity, but rather ‘an always other promise of futurity’ (p. 7). Hill's remarkable scholarship and profound theoretical analysis are complemented by a compelling portrait of Blanchot as a thinker unequivocally committed to the future. The premise of Hill's book is to examine Blanchot's rethinking of the fragment, beginning in the late 1950s. Turning away from the narrative prose of his early fiction, Blanchot pursued an explicitly fragmentary writing in L'Attente l'oubli (1962), Le Pas au-delà (1973), and L'Écriture du désastre (1980), each the focal point of separate chapters here. While the texts are subject to close reading, much of the commentary involves situating the conception of the fragmentary that emerges from each of the key texts in relation to a wide range of thinkers from Hegel and the Jena Romantics to contemporaries such as Derrida and Levinas. If fragmentary writing bears a trace of the future, it also bears a trace of the impossible, and is thus not an identifiable literary or philosophical genre, but rather a spectral demand. Hill is keen to stress Blanchot's anxiety, following Derrida, that rethinking the elliptical or fragmentary can run the risk of ‘I've said virtually nothing and take it back immediately’ (p. 7), but this resistance of the fragmentary to any form of identity is actually where its radical potential might be found. In this respect, Hill stresses the proximity of fragmentary writing to political exigencies in Blanchot's thought. Blanchot's turn to fragmentary writing coincided with his return to active involvement in politics in the late fifties. The relationship between literature and politics is thus regularly evoked where it is not explicitly mapped out. The interruption of historical continuity affirmed in the thought of désastre is echoed in Blanchot's response to May 1968. Just as the thought of désastre can be understood in one formulation as less concerned with the negation of the world than putting its existence into parentheses in order ‘to reflect on its meaningful articulation’ (p. 307), the events of '68 are similarly affirmed for a suspension, or ‘putting into parentheses of normative politics’ (p. 234). Hill's refreshingly assertive portrait of Blanchot's philosophical and political thought is just one of many immensely significant contributions to Blanchot scholarship found in this multifaceted study. While the prose is lucid and consistently engaging, readers less familiar with Blanchot might be better advised to begin with Hill's earlier Blanchot: Extreme Contemporary (London: Routledge, 1997).",Art | Biology | Computer science | Database | Deconstruction (building) | Dialectic | Ecology | Epistemology | Hegelianism | History | Law | Library science | Linguistics | Literature | Modernity | Narrative | Negation | Philosophy | Political science | Premise | Relation (database) | Scholarship | Subject (documents) | TRACE (psycholinguistics),https://openalex.org/W2328853989,1.0,,"Crossref, OpenAlex",16
10.1093/fs/kny207,<i>Blanchot and the Moving Image: Fascination and Spectatorship</i>. By <scp>Calum Watt</scp>,Michael Holland,,2018,2018-07-19,French Studies,Liverpool University Press,article,en,False,"One of the striking things to emerge from Calum Watt’s impressive study is the extent to which contemporary discussion of the art of film draws on Maurice Blanchot’s thought. This gives rise to what he calls the ‘animating paradox’ (p. 4) behind his book: the fact that an author exclusively devoted to literature should turn out to offer both film theorists and filmmakers the means to reflect on and conceptualize the art of film. His detailed research reveals the considerable attention paid to Blanchot by cinema theorists such as Marie-Claire Ropars-Wuilleumier and Raymond Bellour, and philosophers such as Jacques Rancière and Gilles Deleuze, who wrote in Cinéma 2: ‘Ce que Blanchot diagnostique dans la littérature se retrouve partout éminemment dans le cinéma’ (cited p. 94). However, Watt’s purpose is not to distil his own theory of film from Blanchot’s writing (‘there can be no such thing as a Blanchotian approach to film’, he says, p. 23), but rather to ‘think film at the same time as pursuing the thought of Blanchot’ (p. 14). Throughout his study Watt remains refreshingly impatient with the limitations of much thinking about film, using Blanchot’s categories to reveal the limitations of various theoretical approaches. In the process, not only does he ambitiously offer ‘a reflection on the direction of film studies’ themselves (p. 168): he persuasively identifies in Blanchot’s writing a ‘filmic imaginary’ that gives it its originality and in whose light key notions such as fascination acquire greater significance. After an introductory survey of some of the biographical and literary connections between Blanchot and film using Derrida’s account of Blanchot’s L’Instant de ma mort (1994) as its starting point, Chapter 1 sets out the key terms that will serve as relays between Blanchot’s thought and film: fascination, désœuvrement, disaster, and the primal scene, all of which derive from Blanchot’s highly original understanding of the imaginary in both his fiction and his thought. Chapter 2 examines Blanchot’s ‘subterranean presence’ (p. 86) in Jean-Luc Godard’s films, in particular Histoire(s) du cinéma (1988–98), with particular reference to the myth of Orpheus. Chapter 3 is devoted to Satantango (1994) by Béla Tarr, who, unlike Godard, does not refer directly to Blanchot in his films, but whose use of the long take establishes a relation to time that can be understood in Blanchotian terms. Chapter 4 brings in Emmanuel Levinas alongside Blanchot for a reading of Gaspar Noé’s ‘problem film’ Irréversible (2002) centred on the question of the Other, which rescues the film from recuperation by ethics, either negatively or positively, by examining the role played by ‘the passive relation of fascination we enter into before the image’ (p. 159). Each of the three films Watt examines, he says, ‘presents an unorthodox conception of time’, and provides an instance of the way, according to Blanchot’s thinking, ‘the image constantly announces in one way or another an annulment of time as linear, irreversible progression’ (p. 158). Occasional obscurities and the misattribution of a poem by Hölderlin hardly detract from the groundbreaking qualities of this study, which does justice independently to each of its subjects.",Aesthetics | Art | Art history | Film theory | Literature | Movie theater | Originality | Philosophy | Physics | Power (physics) | Psychoanalysis | Psychology | Qualitative research | Quantum mechanics | Social science | Sociology | The Imaginary | Watt,https://openalex.org/W2890617562,0.0,,"Crossref, OpenAlex",16

Motte Alain P. Toumayan . Encountering the Other: The Artwork and the Problem of Difference in Blanchot and Levinas. Pittsburgh: Duquesne University Press, 2004. 231 pp. Alain Toumayan remarks in his introduction that his intent in this book is not to provide an overview of the work of Maurice Blanchot and Emmanuel Levinas, but rather to focus on a few exemplary intersective moments in their work, moments that testify to their mutual influence. What he finds most intriguing is the manner in which both thinkers address the problem of difference and the question of the other, in ways that make apparent the richness of their intellectual conversation. The key term in Toumayan's analysis is that of the ""encounter,"" which points toward a variety of concerns here: the encounter of Blanchot and Levinas, certainly and most obviously, but also the encounter of philosophy and literature, and, more generally still, that of the subject and the other. In his first chapter, Toumayan meditates on the dialectic of identity and difference, and upon the manner in which the subject in Blanchot and Levinas is constituted differentially. Reading Blanchot and Levinas's texts as ""case studies of difference"" (43), and staging his discussion through a rehearsal of Saussure, Heidegger, and Derrida's thought, he argues that Levinas's construct of the il y a serves both of them as a useful tool in their reflections on the question of difference, even if the results of those reflections diverge. Levinas's ethical subjectivity insists upon identity as deriving from the responsibility to the other, while Blanchot constantly returns to the oppositional quality of the encounter, the way the other disrupts the subject in productive fashion. Turning to the problem of death in his second chapter, Toumayan suggests that for both thinkers, death is the privileged figure of alterity, an inevitable and irreducible problem in any interrogation of difference. In Levinas's Le Temps et l'autre, he sees an articulation of death as an absolute other, and a characteristic passivity of the subject when faced with death. In Blanchot's L'Instant de ma mort, he draws our attention to the way Blanchot suspends the instant of death, refuting any possibility of truth therein. In chapter three, Toumayan invokes two mythological narratives of encounter, involving Orpheus and Ulysses respectively, and thinks about the ways Blanchot and Levinas meet them. Blanchot's principal [End Page 122] concern as he read the Orpheus myth is the question of artistic inspiration. Pointing toward Orpheus's forgetfulness and his lack of care, he argues that inspiration results from failure. Like death, inspiration ""is ultimately a relation with otherness,"" Toumayan suggests (99)—the crucial difference being that we survive the encounter. Both Blanchot and Levinas read Ulysses's encounter with the Sirens against the traditional grain, according to Toumayan, seeing failure instead of victory—but a failure that is ultimately productive of meaning. Like the artwork itself, meaning is something that continually and ineluctably escapes from the artist. The fourth chapter deals with the way that Blanchot and Levinas conceive the image. For the latter, Toumayan believes, the image's power ""derives from a being's noncoincidence with itself; a simple, autonomous conception of identity is not sufficient to contain being"" (117). The image is located in time, but represents time, for Levinas, as an entretemps, an intertime that oscillates precariously between time and timelessness, and causes us to question our status as temporal beings. For his part (and drawing liberally upon Levinas's analyses), Blanchot sees in the image both the (incomplete) disappearance of the world and a resemblance, or a doubling of the object. Here, Toumayan traces Blanchot's reflections with particular resourcefulness and attention to detail, demonstrating convincingly how they ""characteristically evolve toward ambiguity"" (139). The final chapter of this book is entitled ""Encountering the Other Night,"" and it deals largely with the ""obscurity or nocturnality"" (145) of the il y a. Toumayan suggests that both Blanchot and Levinas meet and grapple with the il y a at moments of darkness, in sites that are largely apart from the...",Aesthetics | Art | Artificial intelligence | Computer science | Construct (python library) | Continental philosophy | Conversation | Dialectic | Epistemology | Identity (music) | Library science | Linguistics | Literature | Philosophy | Programming language | Psychoanalysis | Psychology | Reading (process) | Subject (documents) | Variety (cybernetics),https://openalex.org/W4237122235,0.0,,OpenAlex,16

In doing so I look at the manner in which Derrida engaged with Blanchot in his work and how in examining this engagement another reading of sovereignty emerges, one which is not tethered to liberal models of sovereign will but one which eludes biopolitical ordering and may be seen as a form of disappearance. Through a reading of Derrida’s readings of Blanchot’s The Madness of the Day I emphasize the link of this alternative sovereignty to both writing and literature in order to demonstrate how a more radical thinking of sovereignty can be discovered in Derrida’s thought.",Art | Biology | Computer science | Deconstruction (building) | Ecology | Economics | Finance | Law | Linguistics | Literature | Operating system | Order (exchange) | Philosophy | Political science | Politics | Reading (process) | Sovereignty | nobody,https://openalex.org/W2126922961,1.0,,OpenAlex,16

Derrida proposes a logic of the plus un, playing on this double meaning in French, where a need to count singularities (‘plus one’) disrupts the unity of community (‘no longer one’). For Derrida, this offers a greater emphasis on those outside the boundaries of constituted communities, something he finds lacking in Blanchot. I demonstrate that Derrida’s position is a challenge to an emerging xenophobic discourse in 1980s French politics.

I use a reading of the Kantian, transcendental account of literature in “How is Literature Possible” as the starting point for an analysis of the way in which Blanchot uses secrets in describing J.’s death in Death Sentence, linking secrecy up with the imaginary, ambiguity and dissimulation. The purpose for this refinement is to challenge the philosophical tradition’s self‐understanding, particularly as exhibited in Hegel. This challenge is seen by reading the account of grief in the first part of Death Sentence as a parody of Hegel’s interpretation of Antigone.

See particularly the second section of ‘Passions’, pp. 12–22. 15 It should be noted that in his discussion of the secret, Derrida rejects this Kantian interpretation, unless it is in the form of a rethought relationship between the regulative ideal and a passion. See the references to Kant at ‘Passions’, pp. 16, 24 and even more the role of the secret in Kant’s moral philosophy in nn. 10 and 12 on pp. 140, 141f.). 16 ‘How is Literature Possible?’, pp. 80f. 17 While the theoretical sense would be the more obvious one in a discussion of the possibilities of experience, there could be an important sense of practical reason as well. This seems to be more developed in the call to write as it plays out in Blanchot’s response to Jean‐Paul Sartre’s What is Literature? in ‘Literature and the Right to Death’, in The Station Hill Blanchot Reader, pp. 359–99. 18 See in particular Edmund Husserl, ‘Origin of Geometry’, available in English as an appendix to Edmund Husserl, The Crisis of European Sciences and Transcendental Phenomenology, trans.

While this proviso needs to be dealt with, for now let it suffice to say that this version of events could itself happen as a sort of first, necessarily forgotten, memory whose significance can only be recognized after the fact. Because I will argue that the temporality of the second series of events depends upon the way in which they are manifested in the narration of Death Sentence and because I will argue that this is itself a description of the temporality constituted by grief and mourning, I believe that it is possible to view this first, forgotten writing of the events of 1938 as the hidden truth of the temporality of the second event. This distinction will itself be important when I turn to the Hegelian heritage of Death Sentence. 35 ‘Passions’, p. 31. Derrida uses the word ‘responsiveness’ in English. 36 ‘How is Literature Possible?’, p. 82. 37 G.W.F. Hegel, Aesthetics: Lectures on Fine Art, trans. T. M. Knox (2 vols, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1995). 38 Ibid., Vol. II, pp. 959–70. 39 Ibid., Vol. I, p. 11. 40 Ibid., Vol. II, p. 964. 41 I will not discuss Derrida’s complex discourse on allegory here. One of the clearest examples of his discussion of allegory is in Jacques Derrida, Memoirs of the Blind, trans. Pascale‐Anne Brault and Michael Naas (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1993). See particularly pp. 119–21. Because this discussion is directly about painting and the eyes, it is somewhat more tangential to the discussion of allegory in poetry. However, Derrida is clearly responding to Hegel’s discourse about the spiritualization of visibility that happens in painting by means of the eye, among other things. For Hegel, the point relevant to painting is that the eye interiorizes the sensuous world, and conversely is also the first way of expressing the interior life. ‘Art … has to convert every shape in all points of its visible surface into an eye, which is the seat of the soul and brings the spirit into appearance’ (Aesthetics, Vol. I, p. 153). Derrida’s discussion of the theme of allegory as the spiritualization or interiorization of the eye is preceded earlier in the book by a lengthy discussion of blindness and lyric poetry and is followed up by the issuance of allegory in confession as making the truth. This sense of confession, of making the truth and of tears is certainly germane to the way in which I want to argue that the narration in Death Sentence takes placed as a form of grieving. Moreover, the blindness of the eye is a theme which could be approached clearly in other récits by Blanchot, perhaps most clearly in Maurice Blanchot, The Madness of the Day, trans. Lydia Davis, in The Station Hill Blanchot Reader, pp. 191–9. To refer more directly to Death Sentence, the aspect of Hegel’s philosophy of art that is taken up in Memoirs of the Blind is perhaps most apparent in J.’s eyes and in the beauty that the narrator says they give to her face while she is dying. ‘Only her eyes which were larger, blacker, and more brilliant than they should have been … had an abnormal fixity’ (Death Sentence, p. 133) The brilliance of her eyes becomes, in the figure of her dying, the beauty of her whole face, as I will discuss later in the paper. Here, let me merely suggest that, in the context of the response to a Hegelian allegory, this beauty might be the beauty of her death becoming a work of art. However, as we will see in her resuscitation and in what Blanchot will call the dissimulated, rather than allegorical, being of the art work, this beauty will be more than a mere consolation after essential questions of truth have died vis‐à‐vis art and literature, as it would have been for Hegel. 42 ‘The Origin of the Work of Art’, in Poetry, Language, Thought, trans. Albert Hofstadter (New York: Harper & Row, 1971), pp. 15–87. The reference to Hegel is in the Addendum, at p. 86. 43 Ibid., p. 19. 44 In this way, Heidegger’s discussion of poetry and thought can be said to continue, or respond to, the structure of encounter manifested in care. See Martin Heidegger, Being and Time, trans. John Macquarrie and Edward Robinson (New York: Harper & Row, 1962). See particularly Part One, Division One, Chapter 6, ‘Care as the Being of Dasein’, pp. 225–72. I will discuss below the significance of care to the discussion of the relation of philosophy to literature. 45 See ‘Literature and the Right to Death’, in The Station Hill Blanchot Reader, particularly the discussion of dying and the impossibility of death at pp. 391–6. 46 In ‘Two Versions of the Imaginary’, Blanchot uses duplicity to refer both to lying and to doubling. See ‘Two Versions of the Imaginary’, p. 426. 47 In ‘How is Literature Possible’, the inherent possibility of miscommunication was the key to unlocking Paulhan’s secret text. ‘How is Literature Possible’, p. 78. 48 ‘Two Versions of the Imaginary’, p. 426. I am assuming that this interplay can be discussed in the same way as the interplay between language and thought. This is a large assumption, but one which, for reasons of space, I will leave undemonstrated. Despite important shifts in emphasis, I believe that the continuity of Blanchot’s discussion of these two forms of interplay can be shown through the non‐originary sense of resemblance which he employs in ‘Two Versions of the Imaginary’. It seems to me that Blanchot is, in fact, refining the way in which neither language nor thought is original by hooking up resemblance, a concept traditionally dependent on its derivation from being, with the outside, wherein supposedly resides the naked contact with reality that thought boasts of. In ‘Two Versions of the Imaginary’, being is shown to depend upon resemblance, the thing that being supposedly renders possible. But this reversal does not end the identification of resemblance with a static, and therefore partially incomplete or fragmentary, moment of being. (Compare particularly the open paradox of the image laid out at pp. 417–19.) If we were to put this in terms of Greek metaphysics, we might say that the so‐called eternity of the eidos is merely an abstraction from the movement of physis, an assertion with parallels in the relationship of logos to both eidos and physis. 49 ‘Two Versions of the Imaginary’, p. 427, n. 1. 50 Death Sentence, p. 131. 51 Ibid., p. 148. 52 ‘Two Versions of the Imaginary’, p. 424. 53 Ibid., p. 422: ‘Only what has surrendered itself to the image appears, and everything that appears is, in this sense, imaginary.’ 54 Ibid., pp. 420–3. 55 Ibid., p. 420. 56 Ibid., p. 422. 57 Maurice Blanchot, ‘Humankind’, in The Infinite Conversation. pp. 130–5. See particularly the discussion of the anonymous community at pp. 133–4. 58 For the exact relation of this to temporality, it would be fruitful to discuss not only grief, but also shock. On this point, it would be particularly worthwhile to look at the problems of temporality emergent in the wake of such commentary on Freud’s Moses and Monotheism (New York: Vintage, 1955) as Jean‐François Lyotard offers in Heidegger and the Jews, trans. Andreas Michel and Mark Roberts (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1990); and that Phillipe Lacoue‐Labarthe and Jean‐Luc Nancy offer in ‘Le Panique Politique’, in Retreating the Political. Simon Sparks (ed.) (London: Routledge, 1997). 59 Death Sentence. pp. 143f. 60 Ibid., p. 145. 61 Ibid., pp. 132, 135–6. 62 Ibid., p. 132. 63 Ibid., pp. 133–4. 64 In this sense, the narrator’s predicament is similar to that faced by many homosexuals when they lose their partners. In both cases, although the responsibility of caring for the loved one in their death comes directly from the loved one, this responsibility cannot necessarily be fulfilled because it is not given any legal recognition. The crucial difference is that the narrator’s responsibility to J. seems to be limited to her death; whether or not they were once lovers is left open, but it is clear that he did not ‘share’ in her life (as he does with Natalie in the second half of Death Sentence) in any meaningful sense of the word. In this respect, it is interesting to compare Judith Butler’s account of Antigone as a queer heroine in Judith Butler, Antigone’s Claim: Kinship between Life and Death (New York: Columbia University Press, 2000) to my argument thatDeath Sentence is in certain respects a gender‐bending retelling of Hegel’s interpretation of Antigone. 65 G.W.F, Hegel, Phenomenology of Spirit, trans. A.V. Miller (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1977), pp. 266–90. See particularly pp. 273–5 for the claim that the relationship between brother and sister is the most ethically significant familiar relationship. 66 E.g. ‘It is well known that for an instant after dying, people who were once beautiful become young and beautiful again: the disease … could do nothing to mar the perfectly beautiful and young (though somewhat hard) expression that illuminated her face’ (Death Sentence, p. 140). 67 Death Sentence, 136. 68 Ibid., p. 133. 69 The point depends upon the near homophony between the Greek word homos (meaning same) and the French word homme (meaning man.) See Luce Irigaray, ‘Women on the Market’, in This Sex Which Is Not One, trans. Catherine Porter (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1985), pp. 170–91 at p. 171–2. For what follows with regard to Heidegger, see also Luce Irigaray, The Forgetting of Air in Martin Heidegger, trans. Mary Beth Mader (Austin: University of Texas Press, 1999), pp. 105–22 (particularly pp. 109–11), where Irigaray engenders Heidegger’s discussion of care in the context (1) of his interpretation of Hölderlin’s ‘holy’, (2) of the materiality of air, and (3) of impregnation, the womb and the tomb. 70 Being and Time, pp. 279–311. On this count, see also Robert Bernasconi, ‘“The Double Concept of Philosophy” and the Place of Ethics in Being and Time’, in Heidegger in Question (Atlantic Heights: Humanities Press, 1993). Bernasconi argues that the picture of authentic Dasein is most properly read as Heidegger’s self‐portrait of philosophical activity. 71 Derrida makes this argument in several places, but one of its most clear formulations is in his interview with Jean‐Luc Nancy, ‘Eating Well’, in Jacques Derrida, Points …: Interviews 1974–1994, Elisabeth Weber (ed.) (Palo Alto: Stanford University Press, 1995), pp. 255–87. 72 The way in which this happens in the Phenomenology of Spirit, from which the concept as Absolute Knowing is directly drawn, is slightly different since Religion is the form of Spirit preceding Absolute Knowing, and Art, in essential truth, is one form of religion. 73 Phenomenology of Spirit, ¶ 30. 74 Ibid., ¶¶ 672–83.",Ambiguity | Art | Art history | Epistemology | George (robot) | Hegelianism | History | Interpretation (philosophy) | Linguistics | Literature | Philosophy | Philosophy and literature | Psychoanalysis | Psychology | Reading (process) | Sentence | The Imaginary | Virtue,https://openalex.org/W1998478540,0.0,,OpenAlex,16

Elena Russo reads Blanchot's work as marked by just such a nostalgic desire to return to a lost Eden in Skeptical Selves: Empiricism and Modernity in the French Novel (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1996). This, however, is to miss the complex philosophy of language that Blanchot begins to develop from his earliest writings on literature. Blanchot, The Infinite Conversation, p.298; L'Entretien infini, p.439. Blanchot, The Infinite Conversation, p.199; L'Entretien infini, p.440. I refer to Blanchot's well known distinction between death and dying, which I will do not have the space to examine here.

Blanchot, The Infinite Conversation, p.90; L'Entretien infini, p.128. Blanchot, The Infinite Conversation, p.90; L'Entretien infini, p.128. For example, one finds the following in one conversation in The Infinite Conversation: 'But then, in this case, we could say – and it is necessary to say – that the Other, this 'Other' in play in the third kind of relation, is no longer one of its terms; it is neither the one nor the other, being nothing other than relation itself, a relation of the one to the other that requires infinity. Neither one nor the other' (The Infinite Conversation, p.74; L'Entretien infini, p.105). See Marlène Zarader, L'être et le neutre: à partir de Maurice Blanchot (Paris: Verdier, 2001).

See Blanchot, 'René Char and the Thought of the Neuter', where he writes, 'Heideggerian philosophy can be understood as a response to this examination of the neuter and as an attempt to approach it in a non‐conceptual manner; but this must also be understood as a new retreat before that which thought seems only able to entertain by sublimating it.' (The Infinite Conversation, p.299; L'Entretien infini, p.440). In a footnote, he adds that although reflection on the difference between being and beings seems to recognise being as a fundamental word for the neuter, 'it is also necessary to rectify this immediately and say: the dignity accorded to being in the summons that would come to us from it, everything that relates in an ambiguous manner Being and the divine, the correspondence between Sein and Dasein, the providential fact that being and the comprehension of being go together – being being that which illuminates itself, opens, and destines itself to beings that become an opening of clarity; the relation, therefore, between Sein and truth, a veiling unveiling itself in the presence of light – all of this does not prepare us to seek the neutral as it is implied by the unknown' (p.458; p.441). Heidegger delivered the lecture courses, Der Anfang des abendländischen Denkens (Heraklit), in 1943 and Logik: Heraklits Lehre vom Logos, in 1944. Material from these lecture courses informed the essays 'Logos' (Heraclitus, Fragment 50) and 'Alétheia' (Heraclitus, fragment 6), both delivered in 1951, published in Vorträge und Aufsätze (Pfullingen: G. Neske, 1954). Heidegger, Early Greek Thinking, trans. David Farrell Krell (New York: Harper & Row, 1975), p.60. Cf. Heidegger, Early Greek Thinking, pp.118–120.

There is little space here to explore the notion of scepticism in Blanchot, which appears in the wake of Levinas's Otherwise than Being or Beyond Essence (1981) and resonates with other words in Blanchot's lexicon like insomnia, awakening, vigilance, neuter, philosophy, testimony, trauma, responsibility, words which he shares with Levinas. See my Blanchot's Vigilance (Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan, 2005) for a discussion of these matters. Heidegger, 'The Origin of the Work of Art', trans. David Farrell Krell, Basic Writings (London: Routledge, 1993), p.61. Blanchot, The Infinite Conversation; L'Entretien infini. When Blanchot writes in a footnote to the chapter 'The Most Profound Question' of a 'hearing that looks', of 'the play of hearing and seeing hearing and seeing is a play wherein there is at play ""what is most high and most profound': The One""; and of the One which 'accomplishes itself as everything' including 'being as gathering, light and unity of being' (pp.439–440; p.33). See also 'Atheism and Writing', where he invokes a writing which 'conceives of itself on the basis neither of vocal nor of visible manifestation, these being merely opposed through a complicitous opposition that is roused where Appearing (l'Apparaître) reigns as meaning, and light as presence: the pure visibility that is also pure audibility' and proceeds to claim that Heidegger, 'in his faithful belonging to the ontological logos, can still affirm that thought is a seizing that seizes by way of the gaze' (p.261; p.390). Barnes, Early Greek Philosophy, B123, p.112. Blanchot, The Infinite Conversation, p.31; L'Entretien infini, p.44. Heidegger, Early Greek Thinking, p.66. Heidegger, Early Greek Thinking, p.66. Heidegger, Early Greek Thinking, p.66. Blanchot, The Infinite Conversation; L'Entretien infini. There is an interesting exchange in one conversation in The Infinite Conversation. The first conversationalist says, 'I wonder whether Heraclitus, when he says of sacred speech that it neither exposes nor conceals, but gives a sign, is not saying something about this. Might one not lend him the idea you wish to present: that there is a language in which things neither show nor hide?'; the second, 'It is perhaps not for us to lend this idea to Heraclitus, but he may be the one to lend it to us' (p.31; p.44). It is a question, for the second speaker, of heeding what is already present in Heraclitus, of what Blanchot calls elsewhere Heraclitus' 'lofty play of writing' rather than drawing out what was as yet hidden to the Greek writer. Martin Heidegger, An Introduction to Metaphysics, trans. Gregory Fried and Richard Polt (London and New Haven: Yale University Press, 2000), p.65. In La Bête de Lascaux, Blanchot writes that those who listened to Xenophon or read Heraclitus 'were present at a very strange event: the birth of philosophy in poetry'.

His writings would seem to belong to the obscurities of the night in such a way that they refuse critical interpretation even as they suggest the possibility of a reflection on the practice of literary-critical reading. There is a sense in which Blanchot is to be located always someplace else, both somewhere beyond his text and sometime not yet contemporaneous with it. The imprint of his hand might hover over the grain of the page cast-ing its hermitic shadow and guarding against what might gather itself there, but this hand, if ever it did, no longer belongs to him. The writer writes, Blanchot argues, to the extent that the writer has always already been writ-ten by writing; writing is what the writer must give up in order to write so that writing, in fact, would carry always within itself a resistance to any of the advances a hermeneutic or metalanguage might feign to hazard.",Art | Biology | Ecology | Economics | Finance | History | Interpretation (philosophy) | Law | Linguistics | Literature | Order (exchange) | Philosophy | Political science | Psychoanalysis | Psychology | Reading (process) | Resistance (ecology) | Shadow (psychology) | Writ,https://openalex.org/W3162089965,0.0,,OpenAlex,15

En este sentido, la tesis intenta probar que la ficcion de Auster es una ficcionalizacion del proceso de escritura y creacion del espacio literario segun las partes que plantea el filosofo frances. El origen de la investigacion comienza en el rol de Paul Auster como traductor de ciertos textos filosoficos del critico frances al inicio de su carrera como escritor. Para justificar la influencia, la tesis ofrece un analisis intertextual entre los dos autores desde el punto de vista de la figura del traductor y como la tarea de traduccion influye en el acto creativo del escritor. El primer capitulo analiza las traducciones realizadas por Paul Auster y un estudio exhaustivo de las cartas que intercambiaron los dos autores. El tercer capitulo de la tesis analiza el concepto de soledad esencial de Blanchot como el primer paso para el proceso creativo en La trilogia de Nueva York (1987) y El palacio de la luna (1989). El cuarto capitulo trata la segunda fase del proceso de creacion del espacio literario que es la figura del escritor y el proceso de escritura en las novelas La trilogia de Nueva York, La noche del Oraculo (2004) y Viajes en el escritorio (2006).

His criticism and narrative fictions from the 1940s elaborate the notion of a 'pure novel', inspired partly by Mallarmé, in response to historical conditions of the Occupation, in an assertion of literary sovereignty after bitter political defeat. Blanchot casts this pure form of writing through figures of light and luminosity that would transcend, even destroy, empirical experience – moving toward the disaster he will later invoke – thus affording a certain evasion from historical realities, while also betraying an intimate relation to their specific concrete historical conjuncture. The argument is not that Blanchot sublimates / allegorises political disappointment through literary narrative (see Jeffrey Mehlman in the 1980s), but that his literary texts enact a relation to factual political and historical responsibility that 'pure' literature fails to liquidate, but rather continually evokes. Tracing out constitutive evasions in Thomas the Obscure, Aminadab, The Madness of the Day, and The Instant of my Death, reveals how Blanchot's fiction betrays a necessary accounting of the author's factual history, a historical responsibility called up in the strange vacuous light of literature itself.",Argument (complex analysis) | Art | Biochemistry | Chemistry | Computer science | Criticism | Database | History | Law | Literary criticism | Literature | Narrative | Philosophy | Political science | Politics | Relation (database),https://openalex.org/W4401086128,0.0,,OpenAlex,15

10.35537/10915/149851,Maurice Blanchot en la crítica literaria argentina: recepción y resistencia,Federico Gabriel Cortés,,2022,2022-12-14,,,dissertation,es,False,"El interés por leer la recepción de la obra de Maurice Blanchot en la crítica argentina surge de una constatación inicial: la presencia mínima y dispersa de dicha obra en el canon de la teoría literaria francesa con el que la crítica argentina ha mantenido una fuerte relación desde mediados del siglo XX hasta la actualidad. No nos referimos, como se verá, a la aparente ausencia de la lectura de Blanchot en trabajos o trayectos críticos de importancia – desmentida por presencias significativas aunque sin dudas escasas–, sino más bien al lugar incómodo, incidental, en apariencia a veces ausente, que Blanchot tiene en la enseñanza de la teoría literaria, en las citas de gran parte de los escritos de la crítica literaria local, así como también en los estudios históricos y críticos de estas disciplinas. Esta tesis, entonces, parte de la hipótesis de que la resistencia a Blanchot tiene dos dimensiones complementarias: al mismo tiempo que hay una resistencia a que la obra de Blanchot integre el conjunto de referencias teóricas de la crítica literaria argentina, hay también una resistencia de la propia obra de Blanchot a dejarse apropiar. Esto ocurre en la medida en que, a partir de una problematización específica de los modos con los que el discurso crítico reduce la ocurrencia de una obra literaria a un fenómeno cultural, la perspectiva blanchotiana impugna la exigencia de intervención (en el debate cultural, social y político) propia de la crítica literaria, así como también la exigencia metodológica de lo aplicable o lo enseñable. Esto redunda en la imposibilidad de situar a Blanchot dentro de los límites de cualquiera de los movimientos o escuelas teóricas que marcaron el proceso de recepción y circulación de ideas y saberes extranjeros durante la segunda mitad del siglo XX en Argentina (llámese marxismo, post marxismo, compromiso sartreano, estructuralismo, postestructuralismo, posmodernismo, etc.). Lo que resiste es el pensamiento de la literatura y la crítica de Blanchot basada en su apuesta por el “poder de impugnación” del arte y la literatura (Blanchot, 1976, 63), en contraste con la constante histórica según la cual la literatura –más allá del modo en que se efectúe y del modo en que sea leída– no puede sino intervenir en los debates culturales. En este contexto, el pensamiento de un poder del arte que busca sustraerse de las determinaciones propias del orden cultural, es decir que encuentra su agencia en el movimiento de desligarse de su función cultural, es introducido y retomado por la crítica argentina de modo tangencial: el juego entre la exigencia de intervención y el poder de impugnación blanchotiano puede ser una buena manera de comenzar a establecer las razones por las cuales la crítica literaria argentina construye cierta idea de teoría y de literatura –estableciendo cánones específicos para cada caso–. Teniendo esto en cuenta, en esta tesis construímos y analizamos un corpus de textos que conforman el espacio material donde ocurre el proceso de la recepción y los usos de la obra de Blanchot, indagando en los vínculos que se pueden establecer entre las distintas temporalidades rastreables en los episodios de recepción.",Art | Humanities | Philosophy,https://openalex.org/W4323669149,0.0,,OpenAlex,15

Departing from an anecdote Parain tells in Jean-Luc Godard’s Vivre sa vie , and from his experiences of the First World War, which both seem to lead to the conclusion that discursive life is nihilistic in a way parallel to Paulhan’s literary terrorists, I trace the argument of Parain’s book in detail. It aims to overcome such conclusions through a restoration of aspects of classical metaphysics (the intelligible realm), the use of Hegel’s theory of mediation, and an account of how language makes structured action, and so the construction of new futures, possible. Blanchot sympathetically takes up Parain’s ideas but insists that a dialectical relation obtains between them and what they aimed to disprove. In so doing, Blanchot begins to develop a paradoxical discourse of contestation and construction that implies the dissolution of the parameters of his own prior nationalisms, both the political and literal (1930s), and literary or more metaphorical (1940–42) kinds.",Art | Humanities,https://openalex.org/W4411871283,0.0,,"Crossref, OpenAlex",15

Blanchot se configura como nosso principal aporte teorico, contudo, outras vozes se somam no decorrer desta escrita. No estudo dos poemas de Henriqueta percebemos uma afinidade com o tema da morte, especialmente nas obras Prisioneira da Noite (1939), A Face Livida (1945) e Flor da Morte (1949), as duas ultimas especialmente. Com o exercicio da escrita, que Henriqueta denomina sua profissao de fe, a poeta mineira foi transmudando cada vez mais seu estilo e a tematica da morte sempre esteve presente.

Seu pensamento navega na direcao do improvavel, do impensado, do (im)possivel de todas as coisas engendradas no limiar da escrita, investimento tracado por uma grafia vigorosa, destiladas nas linhas que irradiam, arrastando-nos para as bandas de um lugar soturno, num espaco onde uma das imagens que nos parece mais caras a Blanchot e a da morte.

The article first sets out Stiegler's invocation of the Blanchotian ‘change of epoch’ in the first volume, which attempts to situate Blanchot within the horizon of technics. I argue Blanchot's disaster is a hidden element in Stiegler's play on the motifs of the star and catastrophe. The article then traces how these motifs emerge in the second and third volumes, in which the technical forms of photography and cinema become more important and where the motifs are woven together through reference to works by Roland Barthes, D. W. Winnicott and Federico Fellini. Stiegler filters these references to apparently disparate figures through Blanchot's analyses of writing and temporality. Tracing both overt and unacknowledged references to Blanchot in Stiegler's text, I conclude that Stiegler's use of Blanchot destabilizes his conceptions of time and epochality.",Art | Art history | Epistemology | Invocation | Literature | Philosophy | Temporality | Theology,https://openalex.org/W2521412576,2.0,,"Crossref, OpenAlex",15

Si Blanchot parle souvent de « fascination » de l'« image » dans ses textes sur la litterature malgre sa critique de la conception opti-centrique de la litterature, qu'est-ce que cela signifie au fond ? On sait que Blanchot a presente un concept saisissant de « ressemblance cadaverique » dans son article sur l'image : « Les deux versions de l'imaginaire ». L'important n'est cependant pas de degager ce concept en le distinguant de la conception blanchotienne de la litterature, mais de l'examiner et l'elucider dans la mesure ou il soutient fondamentalement celle-ci. La presente etude propose d'analyser, dans cette optique, les textes de Blanchot principalement dans les annees quarante et cinquante.

,"Unworking poetic address : a comparative study on Emily Dickinson, Maurice Blanchot, Paul Celan and Jean-Luc Nancy",Tania Ganitsky,,2018,2018-06-01,,,dissertation,en,,"This thesis studies the element of poetic address in the work of two poets for whom address is a relational element that is connected to an awareness of finitude: Emily Dickinson and Paul Celan. Their poems privilege the idea of sending rather than saying; and focus more on addressing, challenging, and diverting yet calling the reader rather than on building meaning. This relational emphasis is also at the center of a discussion on community and literature held between Maurice Blanchot and Jean-Luc Nancy in the 1980s, which is predominantly studied from political perspectives that regard their concern with the literary as imprecise or secondary. I claim that, in their quest to think of an alternative form of community that is not based on the production of a common essence by its members, the State and institutions, they privilege and revalue literary address. By thinking about literature in the light of dying and finitude, Blanchot and Nancy stress its potential to open up relations with others at the limit of what is common, present, and representable. Their reflections thus provide an illuminating framework to help us understand the notions of address developed by both poets. Moreover, I seek to show that the differences between these two philosophers’ positions correspond to certain significant differences in the notion of address in Dickinson and Celan’s work. This allows me to develop a comparative reflection on the pairs Blanchot-Dickinson and Celan-Nancy.",Poetry | Privilege (computing) | Meaning (existential) | Element (criminal law) | Politics | Focus (optics) | Literature | Philosophy | Epistemology | Sociology | Art | Law | Political science | Physics | Optics,https://openalex.org/W2947414043,0.0,,OpenAlex,15

10.1353/cul.2014.a559313,Totality and the Common: Henri Lefebvre and Maurice Blanchot on Everyday Life,Jen Hui Bon Hoa,,2014,2014-09-01,Cultural Critique,,article,en,False,"Totality and the CommonHenri Lefebvre and Maurice Blanchot on Everyday Life Jen Hui Bon Hoa (bio) The “everyday,” defined as that which escapes regimes of signi-fication and bureaucratic regulation, is often considered subversive because it disrupts totalizing narratives and calls forth new political practices and subject positions. Although Henri Lefebvre is generally cited as the principal theorist of everyday life, this particular definition is clearly modeled on Maurice Blanchot’s and, later, Michel de Certeau’s ideas—which, I seek to demonstrate, are fundamentally at odds with Lefebvre’s.1 A notion of the everyday as purely a source of ontological or epistemological instability can accommodate neither Lefebvre’s sociological critique of it, nor his vision for its transformation. The association of the everyday with resistance to representation nonetheless seems to derive from a partial reading of Lefebvre, who famously describes the everyday as an indeterminate “residue,” defined negatively by exclusion from special events and activities. In the neglected, second part of this definition, however, Lefebvre adds that the everyday thus constitutes a “common ground” that, in relating these specific experiences and practices to one another, enables us to conceive of lived reality as an organic whole (2008a, 97). This dialectic of residue and common ground underpins Lefebvre’s approach to everyday life. Lefebvre’s foregrounding of everyday life as a site of commonality speaks to a conception of critical theory as that which makes connections between disparate elements of social life and disciplinary approaches to its analysis, thus furthering the understanding of the social totality. Committed to a revolutionary political project, Lefebvre believes theory’s role is to orient individual practices in local contexts by mapping, as far as possible, the historical and global horizon of [End Page 54] political activity. While recent discussions of everyday life tend to offer one-dimensional attacks on the coercive nature of totalizing theories, Lefebvre’s approach first rebuts the opposition of totality and difference that condition such attacks and then draws attention to what is lost with an outright dismissal of the notion of totality. Understood dialectically, totality emerges not as a deterministic theory of history or society but as a heuristic that illuminates relationships between conditions and effects, personal experience and institutions. For Lefebvre, totality is a hermeneutic context that allows difference to become visible and meaningful, rather than one that suppresses difference in order to defend a teleology or unitary definition of society.2 From this definition of the common in terms of social totality arises a second set of ideas about the relationship between commonality and political practice. As is often forgotten, Lefebvre’s critique of everyday life is a critique specifically of the privatization of everyday life. In response to a perceived depoliticization during the prosperous post-war years, expressed by a general disengagement from the public sphere and loss of faith in collective action, Lefebvre identifies in the common ground of everyday life a possible source of solidarity. It is by producing a critical discourse of everyday life—by turning residual, untheorized everyday experience into communicable experience (Erlebnis into Erfahrung, to use Walter Benjamin’s terms)—that one can reframe ostensibly private and individual experiences in terms of a collective struggle. In this essay, I begin by examining the disjunctions between Lefebvre’s and Blanchot’s notions of everyday life, and show how the latter has dictated the terms of Lefebvre’s reception in Anglo-American scholarship. I then focus on the overlooked question of the common in Lefebvre’s theory of everyday life as a way of mediating between his approach and Blanchot’s. Whereas Blanchot is unequivocal in his rejection of totality, he echoes Lefebvre’s insistence on dismantling the idea of the self-identical, atomized subject and articulating a mode of collective existence. For both writers, this engagement with the question of the common anchors their claims to the political significance of the everyday. It is, however, a very different notion of the common and, consequently, of politics, that emerges from their two theories. By examining the idea of the common in Lefebvre’s critique of everyday life and in Blanchot’s reworking of it, I identify two models of political [End...",Aesthetics | Dialectic | Epistemology | Everyday life | Law | Linguistics | Narrative | Philosophy | Political science | Politics | Representation (politics) | Sociology,https://openalex.org/W4379805297,2.0,,OpenAlex,15

Depending on both the context in which it appears and a phase of Blanchot's oeuvre, the meaning of this term, as Smock observes, does not remain limited only to a designation of Blanchot's later narratives but acquires an almost synonymous status with a notion of entretien.1 Blanchot, however, is not alone in perpetuating this polysemia. For literary critics, the récit as a category became equally elusive—at once too broad and too specific. Meaning a ""narrative"" in general, récit has been used as an indefinite notion embracing many prose genres, to the point when it ceases to be clear if it does not coincide with narrative literature as such. At the same time, it has also served to identify a stylistic specificity found in the select works of only a few writers. This latter use finds perhaps its most exemplary illustrations in André Gide's L'Immoraliste and Albert Camus's La Chute. Gide, in particular, was quite meticulous in differentiating between his novels and their complex view of life, and his récits that portray life from a single perspective. Blanchot's insistence on the difference between the novel and the récit is equally scrupulous, but for other reasons. His emphasis on a strong generic meaning of the term récit—which is evident in spite of the semantic overload this notion sometimes undergoes in his theoretical texts—has nothing to do with the number of points of view represented in the story. For Blanchot, the récit is a distinct literary form whose uniqueness resides in its not merely stylistic but ""essential"" difference from the genre of the novel. With anything essentialist immediately becoming a target of de-constructive scrutiny, Blanchot risks that under a vigilant eye of a literary critic the récit's alleged essence will quickly evaporate and what [End Page 121] will remain will, indeed, be only a handful of stylistic peculiarities. This had been the case with many readings of Blanchot, even though recently many critics have offered much more rigorous interpretations of the récit, as both Blanchot's critical concept and a form of his narratives.2 In a brief piece written shortly after Blanchot's death, Michael Holland even ventured a bold statement, proposing that since ""Blanchot gave priority to narrative,"" research on Blanchot ""should begin with fiction and stay with it.""3 This is, needless to say, no easy task. As Paul de Man admitted already forty years ago, Blanchot's narratives are virtually inaccessible in their obscurity. According to de Man, the best way to get to them is through Blanchot's own critical essays, although even these are not always transparent. De Man chose Blanchot's articles on Mallarmé, a choice that suited well the purpose of explaining Blanchot's take on language but that proved less suitable for showing how these ideas applied more specifically to narrative literature. In the end, de Man does not have much to say about Blanchot's theory of narration or about his stories, and merely presents a truism that ""some of Blanchot's fictions are called novels, while others are called récits.""4 Yet the danger is not only in reducing Blanchot's understanding of the récit to a short novella. What has appeared in many otherwise remarkable studies of Blanchot written in the past ten years is a tendency to overemphasize the fact that Blanchot eventually abandoned récit and extended his understanding of narrative on more discursive types of prose.5 Although this is true, and becomes crucial in examining Blanchot's later contribution to the theme of testimony and fragmentary writing, it is important to point out that Blanchot does not replace récit with écriture.6Récit, écriture, and entretien all retain their crucial positions in Blanchot's writings, none fully coinciding with the other, and all instead adding to the strength of...",Archaeology | Art | Context (archaeology) | Epistemology | History | Law | Literature | Meaning (existential) | Narrative | Perspective (graphical) | Philosophy | Political science | Politics | Visual arts,https://openalex.org/W2028569540,4.0,,OpenAlex,15

,Sacred Time/Ecological Time in Beckett's Waiting for Godot (with a little help from Maurice Blanchot),Carl Lavery,,2015,2015-12-03,,,article,en,,"My argument takes as its premise the idea that western theatre, what we might call, in
shorthand, Aristotelian theatre, invests in a theological notion of time, which I associate, on the
one hand, with a causal, linear narrative (beginning, middle, end), and, on the other, with a
viewing experience which produces an absorptive temporality, rooted in a kind of
weightlessness, a mode of temporal transcendence, an exiting from the earth. By taking us out
of time, by abstracting us from our bodies, the dramatic logic of western theatre, invests in a
time of redemption, in which the temporality of artificial/staged events is perceived as being
somehow more real than time itself. Against synchronous identification and the time of drama,
the article argues that Samuel Beckett’s Waiting for Godot, purposively produces an experience
of ‘presentness’, in which the subject – the spectator – is compelled to undergo an alternative
temporality – the time of waiting. This is immanent time, the time of a different theatrical event,
the time in which, to cite Beckett’s Endgame, ‘something takes its course’. ‘Presentness,’ as I
define it here, has nothing in common with what the art critic Michael Fried sees as a moment
of grace, and neither does it refer to an act of metaphysical self-coincidence. Rather, it is best
seen as an ambivalent, impossible mode of temporality which I term ‘sacred time’. Crucially,
this is not the time of cycles and myths; more disconcertingly, as in the sense of the English
adverb presently, this is a time that is never quite here, a time of deferral, suspension and disappointment.
The time, then, that I am interested in designating as sacred or as presentness has
much in common with Maurice Blanchot’s notion of time as disaster or catastrophe; it is time
that never arrives primarily, and scandalously, because it is always already here, weighing on
us, insisting on its absent but irreducible gravity. It is a time that roots us to the earth.",Temporality | Nothing | Drama | Philosophy | Eternity | Presentism | Aesthetics | Premise | Literature | Narrative | Art | Epistemology,https://openalex.org/W2586228104,0.0,,OpenAlex,15
10.1093/fs/knx249,The Writing of Terrorism: Contemporary American Fiction and Maurice Blanchot. By Christian Kloeckner.,Leslie Hill,,2017,2017-10-25,French Studies,Liverpool University Press,article,en,False,"The contemporary American novel, as exemplified by Paul Auster (Leviathan, 1992), Philip Roth (American Pastoral, 1997), and Bret Easton Ellis (Glamorama, 1998), and the essays and fiction of Maurice Blanchot may at first sight seem strange bedfellows. And yet, as this intriguing study shows, following the fall of Soviet Communism and the so-called ‘end of history’ that shortly followed, the 1990s not only witnessed the publication of numerous novels in the United States deeply concerned with the apparent rivalry between the terrorist and the contemporary avant-garde artist, each committed, as it were, to producing a uniquely spectacular, often devastating experience destructive of all complacency, but also saw the translation into English of a number of essays and récits by Blanchot, some of which were translated by Auster himself, while still in Paris searching for his own voice, and others by his partner at the time, the writer Lydia Davis. As early as 1947 Blanchot, drawing on Jean Paulhan’s convoluted opposition between Rhetoric and Terror (i.e. Classicism and Romanticism), had made much of Hegel’s Phenomenology in the effort to bind the concept of the Terror, as manifested by the French Revolution, with the absolute freedom of the artwork. In enlisting Blanchot’s thinking in order to understand better the relation between literature and violence, Christian Kloeckner does not aim, however, to examine the thematic treatment of terrorism in selected novels as such, but rather ‘to analyse [them] for the ways in which they relate terrorism to the act of writing and the question of literature’s power’ (p. 19). To this end, he offers an often astute, well-informed analysis of Auster’s early prose and poetry, and tracks with illuminating persistence the trace left on Auster by his encounter with Blanchot. But it is not until the discussion of Auster’s Leviathan that the book properly comes into its own, providing a compelling and detailed account of the novel’s multiple doublings, its precarious condition of radical incompletion, and its strange dual logic of construction and destruction, reminiscent, the author suggests, of Blanchot’s thinking of the ‘neutre’. In Auster’s novel, Kloeckner concludes, ‘there is a rupture radically different in nature to that of the bomb’, insofar as it is in writing, not political violence, that one finds, in Blanchot’s celebrated phrase, ‘la violence la plus grande, car elle transgresse la Loi, toute loi et sa propre loi’. Turning to American Pastoral, a markedly different text in ‘intention, scope, and style’, as he plainly acknowledges, Kloeckner similarly explores ‘transgressions and erosions of boundaries’ as a manifestation of the Burkean or Kantian sublime. Examining the fictional violence of Glamorama as (in every sense) a ‘borderline case’, he argues that in the end the often desperate radicality of modern experience is to be found less in political terror than in writing. As Mallarmé famously put it, following an anarchist attack on the Assemblée nationale in 1893, in words to which Kloeckner returns time and again throughout this thought-provoking book: ‘Je ne sais pas d’autre bombe, qu’un livre’.",Archaeology | Art | Communism | Epistemology | Hegelianism | History | Law | Literature | Opposition (politics) | Phenomenology (philosophy) | Philosophy | Political science | Politics | Reactionary | Rhetoric | Romanticism | Terrorism | Theology,https://openalex.org/W2774955833,0.0,,"Crossref, OpenAlex",15

In 1953, the year in which Heidegger delivered the lecture ‘The Question concerning Technology’, Maurice Blanchot claimed that writing was one technique among others.1 In this year La Nouvelle Revue française was relaunched as La Nouvelle Nouvelle Revue française and Blanchot was able, as regular contributor, to set out his own critical stall with confidence and, while still being a topical book reviewer, reach beyond the immediate present to broaden the scope of his essays. Two further essays published that year consider the relationship between art and technology. In the first of these, Blanchot acknowledges the emancipatory and transformative potential of modern technology, arguing that art does not negate this potential but it does express and perhaps accomplish relationships that precede all objective and technological accomplishment.2 He makes a similar point in the second essay, where he writes that before the inventions of technology, the use of radio waves, and the transmission of images, we could hear changes that thanks to these new technologies seem unremarkable today in the affirmations of Hölderlin and Mallarmé.3 Art and modern technology display similar characteristics, Blanchot writes of an anonymous humming associated with both; but there are also important differences: art is not subordinate to a functional teleology and literature in particular is described as an originary experience that precedes all objective and technological accomplishment. There is a distinction in Blanchot between techniques of liberation and transformation, and techne, which precedes but does not exclude or oppose technology as progress. In this article, I will trace the development of Blanchot’s thought to demonstrate how a thinking of techne informs his own literary and theoretical practice up to and including the fragmentary writing of his later texts.",Aesthetics | Art | Art history | Hum | Law | Literature | Opposition (politics) | Pedagogy | Performance art | Philosophy | Political science | Politics | Sociology | Transformative learning,https://openalex.org/W2948713815,1.0,,OpenAlex,15

Blanchot's most extensive references to Benjamin appear in a text entitled “Translating.” This essay was composed on the basis of notes that Blanchot took while reading Benjamin's essay “Die Aufgabe des Übersetzers” and that have remained unpublished. These notes, which consist mainly of translations of passages from Benjamin's essay are a rich source of insight into Blanchot's reading process, which resulted in a powerful affirmation as well as a radical transfiguration of Benjamin's theory of translation. They also shed light on the similarities and differences between the two thinkers' respective theories of translation, their philosophies of language, and the divergent traditions in which their thinking is embedded.",Art | Art history | History | Linguistics | Literature | Philosophy | Reading (process),https://openalex.org/W1974199737,4.0,,OpenAlex,15

It utilises a mixed method qualitative approach weaving interviews with PhD students, doctoral research, auto-ethnography and Blanchot’s analysis. Blanchot (1989) has re-crafted Hegel’s story of the modern subject into the story of the writing subject. He contends that in order to achieve the mastery of a finished ‘work’, a writer must firstly make a leap into the unknown. This can result in the experience of loss and anxiety. Such feelings are indeed common to the PhD experience. However in Blanchot’s account, inspiration is tenacious and ubiquitous. If the writer persists with their writing, they will find a way out of their confusion. Blanchot’s analysis provides encouragement to the PhD student to persist, even during the difficult and arid times of thesis writing.

Of particular interest are the private photos reproduced in the Cahier, given Blanchot's extreme reticence to appear before the public eye. In order to critically consider the new photographs and the visibility they offer, I propose to trace Blanchot's own thoughts on photography throughout several of his philosophical and literary works. While visual aesthetics at first appear rather underrepresented in Blanchot's writings, once the photographic is sought out its appearances are manifold, and a coherent position emerges. In this article, I build my position on the Cahier's publication through my research on Blanchot's writings around the photographic medium, which touch questions of private and public representation, encounters of absence and presence, memory and celebrity.

Here, the human becomes an other facing the Other having an absolute singular relation every single moment causing the strangeness and the interruption in their being. By reading Ibn ‘Arabi’s idea of the Onness/Manyness while thinking of Blanchot’s new kind of relationship, it is argued that God and the human are neither the One nor the many.

For Blanchot, the romantic theory of literature originally formulated through the fragmentary collections of writings of Friedrich Schlegel and Novalis, as well as the scandalous and virtually unreadable publications attached to the name of the Marquis de Sade, places the historical phenomenon of terror at the heart of the aesthetic project of modern literature through which many notable writers of twentieth-century European modernism continued to work. Terror is a fascinating concept for Blanchot precisely because of its historical trajectory out of the space of revolutionary politics and into the space of modern literature.

Clandestine Encounters : Philosophy In the Narratives of Maurice Blanchot. Notre Dame, IN: U of Notre Dame P, 2010. This collection of essays identifies Blanchot as a ""philosophical novelist."" Arranged in chronological order of composition, the twelve essays comprising the collection follow Blanchot's narratives from his first récits written in the mid-1930s to L'Instant de ma mort written in 1994. While the entire collection focuses on the philosophical import of Blanchot's narratives, the perspectives and approaches through which this issue is explored are wide-ranging. All of the essays, however, rethink the relations between the philosophical and the literary, and in doing so, they further an understanding of how one might read Blanchot well. In the introduction, we learn that Blanchot's philosophical ideas can be traced to Ancient Greek skepticism. The ""philosophical,"" as Blanchot conceives it, is an unrelenting engagement in the act of questioning and a rigorous undoing of an apparent order. The philosopher, ""the person of 'double speech'"" (9) elaborates a discourse on a theoretical subject while also responding to a ""dis-course"" of the Outside which deeply challenges the discussion's foundations, forcing the philosopher to question the discussion's premises and conclusions. Skepticism, for Blanchot, is directly related to language, which is in and of itself aporetic. As Christopher Strathman notes in his essay on Aminadab, Blanchot identifies language as the primordial groundwork of reality, but he also examines how language calls into question the complex connection between being and nothingness. The introduction identifies the Outside as a key concept in the works of Blanchot, and accordingly, the Outside is recurrently explored in the collection's twelve essays. While the Outside is an essential concept, Blanchot's varying descriptions of the Outside make it difficult to determine its exact meaning. The Outside is the neutral, passive language that holds an author between being and non-being. The Outside is the ""something beyond or beneath being itself"" (12) that the artist experiences through the act of creation, an act which entails the choice of nonbeing over being. In regard to the everyday, however, the Outside has political implications; it is what ""makes the everyday a site of continuous contestation"" (14). Most importantly, the Outside is what facilitates the writing of a récit. As opposed to a roman which consists of events that take place in time, a récit focuses on one event that has taken place. For the récit to begin, the artist must be ""drawn to the point where being and image pass endlessly into one another"" (18), the artist must come into contact with the Outside or that which ""flows beneath being"" (18). The récit is thus an ideal medium for the philosophical, because the philosophical is, in essence, a response to the ""lure of the Outside."" (18) The first essay entitled The Glory and the Abyss, jointly written by Vivian Liska and Arthur Cools, explores the connection between politics, literature, and the Outside. The essay focuses on how Blanchot's first récits, ""Le Dernier Mot"" (1935) and ""L'Idylle"" (1936), fundamentally transform literary space. [End Page 967] Although written in the mid 1930's, the récits were first published in 1947, and in 1951 they were assembled in a volume entitled Le Ressassement éternel. The ten-year gap between the completion and publication of the récits underscores an experience of estrangement in response to World War II. In his afterword to Le Ressassement éternel, ""Après coup,"" Blanchot himself admits how he feels alienated from his own stories. Rupture and alienation come to characterize Blanchot's literary aesthetic after World II, ""his poetics of impersonality, of the absent author and the disappearance of the narrator and the speaking subject itself"" (33). Grouped together in reverse chronological order in Le Ressassement éternel, the récits highlight the breakdown of narrative and the initial encounter with the Outside. While the linear, cohesive narrative in ""L'Idylle"" presents a totalitarian society in which every trace of the outside has been erased, the disjointed narrative in ""Le Dernier Mot"" rebels...",Art | Computer science | Economics | Epistemology | Finance | Library science | Linguistics | Literature | Narrative | Order (exchange) | Philosophy | Psychoanalysis | Psychology | Skepticism | Subject (documents) | Undoing,https://openalex.org/W2026514305,0.0,,OpenAlex,15
,Chiasme dialogique : le partage du sensible dans L'attente l'oubli de Maurice Blanchot,Alexandre St-Onge,,2006,2006-06-01,,,article,fr,,"L'œuvre de Maurice Blanchot, si importante soit-elle pour la pensee litteraire de la seconde moitie du vingtieme siecle, demeure l'une des plus difficiles a cerner. Tenter d'extraire quelque chose de substantiel qui permettrait au lecteur de comprendre l'œuvre blanchotienne est une tâche des plus ardues. Comment entendre le sens d'une pensee incarnee par l'ecriture qui precisement desire veiller sur le sens absent? Je tente a travers ce memoire de voir comment la pensee blanchotienne remet radicalement en question l'aspect conceptuel du langage comme outil de communication afin de l'ouvrir a son etrangete constitutive: ce chiasme inalienablement materiel qui est le seul espace de communication possible au dela de toute pensee conceptuelle et ideologique. A partir du recit L'attente l'oubli, je tente de voir comment chez Blanchot l'ecriture n'est pas seulement le vehicule d'un message quelconque mais se deploie aussi comme de la matiere-langage ou le sens s'absente. La forme fragmentaire du recit et l'utilisation excessive de la forme paradoxale detournent constamment le sens de ce qui est ecrit vers un ailleurs inacessible et ne donnent a entendre au lecteur que la resonance spectrale des voix qui narrent le recit. L'attente l'oubli se developpe comme un etrange dialogue de sourds ou les narrateurs semblent a la recherche d'un dialogue a venir. En fait, ils lancent, telles des bouteilles jetees a la mer, des appels vers l'autre sans savoir si il y aura un echo. Les deux narrateurs semblent bien etre separes l'un de l'autre par un chiasme. Cette separation est l'espace de ce que je nomme chiasme dialogique. Cette idee inspiree par la pensee blanchotienne me permet de repenser la relation a l'autre comme une forme de partage du sensible au-dela du conceptuel et de l'ideologique. L'attente l'oubli de Maurice Blanchot n'est donc pour moi qu'un point de depart pour redefinir la relation a l'alterite comme une passion de l'etrangete materiellement situable : nulle part ailleurs qu'ici.

Attention is focused on the cultural understanding of the essential content of the categories — artistic space; artistic activity; creativity as an act of creation; the artist as a separate selfsufficient individual in the process of birth and embodiment of an artistic work. The content and functions of artistic creativity are explained from the point of view of the form of human activity, the way of being in the world, its self-affirmation and self-development, the means of existence of the individual. These features are determined by the specificity of the artistic worldview, the result of which is the subject's reproduction of himself. The author proves that artistic creativity ensures not only the affirmation of a person in the world as a complete individual, but also the free expression of his creativity according to the laws of beauty on the way of transforming his own life. The article examines the essence of artistic culture as a type of culture that expresses the worldview of the subject and the system of his sociocultural orientations, and also provides an opportunity to understand its transformation and historical sociodynamics as a self-sufficient component of the cultural space and system of the latest theorizing. It is emphasized that the postmodern world of scientific understanding of creativity shone with many different theoretical colors, absorbing the entire complex of conceptual theorizing of creativity. The author describes European scientific currents and concepts, which during the 20th century presented updated and more meaningful theoretical reflections of creativity. It has been proven that the formation of an interdisciplinary and cultural approach to the artistic existence of humanity is vividly reflected not only in purely theoretical works. As the conclusion states, the book of the French culturologist, philosopher, writer Maurice Blanchot ""The Space of Literature"" translated by Leonid Kononovich, precisely ensures the integrity and harmony of the cultural theorization of creativity as a type of cultural activity, adding to our modest reflections a complete content and conceptual content.",Aesthetics | Anthropology | Archaeology | Art | Beauty | Comprehension | Computer science | Context (archaeology) | Creativity | Epistemology | Expression (computer science) | History | Library science | Linguistics | Philosophy | Programming language | Psychology | Social psychology | Sociocultural evolution | Sociology | Space (punctuation) | Subject (documents),https://openalex.org/W4385081449,0.0,,OpenAlex,15

Avec le parti pris de differencier ces textes de l'oeuvre theorique de blanchot, ils sont envisages comme revelateurs de ce qu'ils portent comme reflexion sur l'ecriture : avec pour idee qu'on ne peut s'en tenir au mode de l'autoreflexivite. Atteignant une portee plus generale, les references litteraires convoquees depassent largement blanchot et visent a temoigner d'une preoccupation commune de la modernite : la poesie, notamment, est exploitee en ce qu'elle participe d'une recherche sur le langage compris comme manifestation d'une presence-absence. Partant de l'hypothese d'un apparaitre textuel, la reflexion va dans le sens d'une phenomenologie critique et reconnait la fiction sous le mode de la feinte. En effet, on en vient a ce constat que si la litterature se replie sur elle-meme, elle engage une figure qui se detourne d'elle au moment ou on croit qu'elle s'eclaire. Ainsi l'analyse montre comment la fiction empeche la pleine abstraction et soutient la figuration en son propre mouvement de destitution. L'aspect litteraire, donne pour exterieur a l'ontologie, se coupe d'un mode d'etre pour apparaitre autrement - par la reinvention d'une pensee qui convoite un temps et un espace qui serait propre a l'ecriture de fiction. Enfin, on pose, sous l'ambiguite intrinseque de la fiction, son dedoublement. La psychanalyse est utilisee comme detour pour fonder une pensee de fictionnalite : c'est-a-dire l'ambivalence d'une pensee qui releve d'une alteration interne. La logique est celle d'un simulacre a lier a l'inscription d'une trace qui indique toujours autre chose que soi, qui, sous le mode apparent du + comme-si ;, engage un ordre de realite dont on ne saurait dire l'intimite parce qu'elle releve d'une exteriorite latente.",Humanities | Philosophy | Art,https://openalex.org/W173176976,0.0,,OpenAlex,15

Nous chercherons à montrer qu’une part de la théorie littéraire de Blanchot s’ébauche dans un dialogue avec son engagement nationaliste. À cette fin, nous nous pencherons plus particulièrement sur la collaboration de Blanchot à un hebdomadaire, L’Insurgé, qui parut de janvier à octobre 1937. Nous situons notre démarche dans une perspective sociologique compréhensive, d’inspiration wébérienne, dont l’un des buts est de saisir le sens que les individus donnent à leurs actes, de comprendre leurs actions dans toute la complexité de leurs existences, à travers les multiples socialisations auxquelles ils sont confrontés. Il s’agira donc de comprendre le sens que donne Blanchot à son engagement à l’extrême droite, comprendre ce que signifie la littérature pour lui à cette époque, et de voir si ces deux significations entrent dans une certaine résonance. Nous tenterons également d’éviter deux écueils : déduire la vision de la littérature de Blanchot de son engagement nationaliste d’une part, et déduire son engagement à l’extrême droite de sa conception de la littérature d’autre part. En effet, il semble que la théorie de la littérature qu’élabore Blanchot dans ces années, et son identification à un imaginaire nationaliste, procèdent d’un même mouvement et fonctionnent dans une même cohérence, sans pour autant q",Computer science,https://openalex.org/W397186585,0.0,,OpenAlex,15

This literary instant in both authors is a revolutionary moment, not just because it interrupts and subverts the status quo, but also because it associates the literary and the political. For both, the revolutionary moment turns out to be a break with a temporality which may be said to be «mythological»: that of the future perfect. Literature creates what is rather an atemporal zero point «as if at the end of time» (Blanchot) or « subtracted from temporality » (Nancy), which interrupts this future perfect. However, this interruption is interpreted very differently by the two thinkers. Their difference of opinion arises from a disagreement about the ontological status of literature. While Nancy understands the revolutionary moment as the differential arch-dynamic of reality itself, Blanchot emphasizes that the revolutionary moment is revolutionary precisely because it brings about a spatio-temporal point that remains unreal.",Temporality | Moment (physics) | Instant | Philosophy | Mythology | Politics | Contradiction | Status quo | Epistemology | Humanities | Theology | Physics | Law | Quantum mechanics | Political science,https://openalex.org/W2888945623,0.0,,OpenAlex,15

,L’opposition langage littéraire / langage ordinaire. La conception littéraire de Maurice Blanchot comme réponse aux sciences du langage,Anca Călin,,2016,2016-01-01,,,article,fr,,"Le systeme conceptuel de Maurice Blanchot s’appuie sur l’opposition entre le langage ordinaire, outil de communication, et le langage litteraire, outil de reflexion au sens d’un travail litteraire sur la langue. Dans le langage ordinaire, le mot est egal a lui-meme. Il se suffit. Il a divers sens identifiables. Dans ce contexte, le mot reste un moyen. Il obeit aux injonctions de l’usage courant de la langue. Le mot a alors le pouvoir d’offrir une certitude dans la perception du sens, mais cela ne peut jamais devenir litterature selon Blanchot. Pour depasser l’usage pratique et fonctionnel de la langue, l’ecrivain fait intervenir ce que l’on appelle communement le style, autrement dit la maniere de faire travailler la langue pour faire ressortir le combat que l’ecrivain mene avec ou contre elle, selon les circonstances. Avec Blanchot, cette relation prend une forme toute particuliere, forme dans laquelle le lecteur joue un role preponderant. Ainsi, quand le lecteur entre dans la phrase, il ne se contente pas de la lire. Il l’ouvre et cherche a creuser ses nuances et ses differences. Il ne s’agit pas de la difference entre les mots, ni de la difference entre plusieurs sens du meme mot. Lire signifie, avec Blanchot, mettre en rapport le mot avec lui-meme : une fois regarde, le mot se defait de l’interieur et se perd en partie dans l’inconnu. Cet inconnu a la meme importance que le mot, l’inconnu devient cette partie du mot, la part cachee, la part du feu pour Blanchot ou la part maudite pour reprendre la formule de Bataille. Arriver a saisir la couche obscure du mot, cela signifie que le lecteur s’est eloigne du langage ordinaire pour entrer dans l’interiorite du langage litteraire. La question qui se pose est de savoir si cette interiorite, une fois exteriorisee par l’ecriture, prend la forme de ce que les linguistes appellent ‘la communication’. La litterature communique-t-elle quelque chose en fin de compte ? Concue par la linguistique comme un transfert d’informations dans le cadre d’un dialogue entre un auteur et un lecteur, la litterature comme acte de communication est contestable pour Blanchot qui sort la litterature de sa forme materielle pour la placer dans une lutte plus intime, celle qui a lieu dans l’epaisseur du mot, lutte qui arrache l’auteur comme le lecteur aux dialogues habituels pour les immerger dans un monde dont l’agencement ne suit plus les regles de la communication : La ou, a la fin, l’oeuvre semble etre devenue le dialogue de deux personnes en qui s’incarnent deux exigences stabilisees, ce “dialogue” est d’abord le combat le plus originel d’exigences plus indistinctes, l’intimite dechiree de moments irreconciliables et inseparables, que nous appelons mesure et demesure, forme et infini, decision et indecision …1 Nous comprenons que, pour Blanchot, meme finie, l’oeuvre litteraire ne « dialogue » pas avec son lecteur, mais le pousse a ouvrir ses innombrables et infinies voies qui preparent son existence. Comment repondent les sciences du langage, la linguistique plus precisement, a cette approche ‘inhabituelle’ d’un texte, qui n’est pas un texte comme les autres, mais un texte litteraire, c’est ce que nous nous proposons d’analyser dans cet article.",Humanities | Philosophy | Art,https://openalex.org/W2954063051,0.0,,OpenAlex,15

Translated by Michael Holland",John McKeane,,2017,2017-02-15,French Studies,,article,en,False,"This is the third of four volumes translating Maurice Blanchot's Chroniques littéraires du 'Journal des débats' (Paris: Gallimard, 2007). Alongside the collection Faux pas (Paris: Gallimard, 1943), the volumes give us an enhanced picture of his literary criticism during the Second World War, after France's capitulation. The articles contained in this volume are fairly brief, and each bears the date of its weekly publication in the Journal des débats, an establishment liberal newspaper then nearing the end of its life. They address classic and contemporary literature, mostly French, but also philosophy, political theory, Christian mysticism, and more. They look at poetry (as Michael Holland's helpful Introduction underlines), but also at the novel — in the period Blanchot was writing and publishing novels of his own (Thomas l'obscur, 1941; Aminadab, 1942; Le Très-Haut, 1948). Literary scholars will therefore be able to play the game of applying Blanchot's criticism to his own writing (for instance, 'it is a novel that, instead of giving a realistic portrayal of war, absorbs it more profoundly into an inner adventure, describing it indirectly through the effects that it has on a mind that is suddenly expelled from itself and exposed to a devastating truth', p. 36). Holland's scholarly work goes far beyond this, however, and with these translated volumes he continues his enterprise of tracking the life that Blanchot spent writing. He has written, scare quotes at the ready, of '[le] groupe des ""Blanchot-positifs""' (Avant-dire: essais sur Blanchot (Paris: Hermann, 2015), p. 180), a striking suggestion of infection or contagion. Throughout Blanchot's writing, too, we find striking formulations: the reader is assaulted by compressed, aphoristic phrases. But we also find an entire conceptual enterprise that seeks to free writing from such phrase-making, and instead turns towards passivity and weakness. The tension between these two aspects offers a trusty path into the depths of Blanchot's œuvre. But are these aspects simultaneous, or chronologically distinct? It is here that these volumes are particularly useful, soliciting approaches that are calm, patient, and evidence-based. For there is no shortage of evidence. These critical articles are abundant, varied, erudite, and the task of reading them without preconceptions will need to be done at length. We see that in 1943 Blanchot was still referring in broadly positive terms to refinement, good breeding, discretion, harmony, the French character, imperiousness, elegance, and so on. But while clarity and lucidity are still important, there is already an awareness of the distortion this light produces when cast over its objects. In short, this is no longer the Blanchot of 1936–37, but neither is it quite the post-war Blanchot, if indeed there is a post-war Blanchot.",Adventure | Aesthetics | Archaeology | Art | Art history | Criticism | History | Law | Literary criticism | Literature | Mysticism | Performance art | Period (music) | Philosophy | Poetry | Political science | Politics | Publishing | World War II,https://openalex.org/W2602155840,1.0,,OpenAlex,15

C’est celle-ci qui fournit le point d’articulation entre les interventions publiques et les textes litteraires de Blanchot. Le role central devolu par cet auteur a la Revolution et a la Loi, ainsi que l’encrage allegorique de ses textes dans les conditions historiques qui president a leur emergence sont des elements qui permettent de les soustraire a l’ideologie neo-moderniste. D’autre part, on a voulu montrer qu’il s’agit d’une œuvre charniere, a partir de laquelle peut etre investigue un double tournant. Celui-ci affecte a la fois la mediation juridique du pouvoir, axee sur la figure du souverain, et la doctrine de l’Etat esthetique fondee sur la relation entre la production de l’art et la constitution du peuple. L’exemple de Blanchot permet d’envisager un renouvellement des conditions representationnelles, et c’est sans doute pour cette raison que cet auteur est devenu une reference inaugurale pour les pensees contemporaines qui se proposent de depasser l’horizon juridico-politique de la souverainete.

A partir de la fin de 1937, Blanchot abandonne en effet des activites de journaliste qui l'ont conduit, malgre un anti-hitlerisme precoce, a faire le jeu de l'antisemitisme ; l'on assiste alors a l'elaboration d'une ecriture cherchant a dejouer les pieges de l'identification du sujet a son langage. Aminadab suppose ainsi une conception de l'image poetique qui, a travers un personnage central, joue un role essentiellement critique, non seulement vis-a-vis d'une notion de sujet fermee sur elle-meme (comme, deja, dans la premiere version de Thomas l'obscur), mais aussi face a une conception stereotypee de l'Histoire. Sur un plan philosophique, cela signifie que la seule critique heideggerienne du sujet husserlien se trouve nuancee par une narration qui introduit, sur l'axe diachronique du recit, un temps en arret : cette dimension synchronique, a la fois effacee et pourtant requise par chacun des actes du protagoniste Thomas, decouvre une autre verite que celle dont se reclament les habitants de la maison , ce lieu unique qui est organise de facon totalitaire et ou l'errance n'a manifestement pas de place.

Não se pode esquecer que há uma discussão nunca interrompida sobre a conversão de Blanchot entre esta década e a posterior, nos anos 40, de certa postura ‘fascista’ a uma postura ‘comunista’ – em se reconhecendo os riscos desta simplificação.

Nessa medida, e porque a criação de ligações também depende dela, tratar-se-á igualmente de considerar a leitura como gesto de reescrita que, mantendo o texto incólume, transforma-o sempre noutro.

Les Cahiers de la Pléiade were launched by Jean Paulhan in 1946 and ran for 13 issues until 1952. ‘Les Deux versions’ was Blanchot’s final of five contributions.2Les Cahiers were set up partly in the wake of the ‘littérature engagée’ of Sartre, publishing authors such as Breton, Céline, Artaud, Char, Ponge and Kafka.3 In contrast to Blanchot’s later, regular publications in La Nouvelle Revue française, those produced for the more expensive, less frequent and less widely circulated Cahiers appear to be primarily occasional or irregular pieces.4 While there are several apparently minor changes made throughout the text (all but two of the original’s 21 paragraphs are modified in L’Espace littéraire), most significantly two key passages are excised.

In this way, many of the essays in this collection explore the nature of time and the way in which Guillevic asks and answers questions of continuity and individuation of moments. For example, Steven Winspur shows how Guillevic’s work opposes time as a succession of units to other cadences that we might conceive and impose. Along these lines, with temporality taken as a dominant trope of Guillevic’s work, there are essays that address primordial time, antiquity, and modernity in Guillevic’s work, with studies of classical materialism and the hic et nunc, as well as modern scientific theory and Guillevic’s use of the term ‘quanta’ for the fragments of such texts as Du domaine. Understood as an adverb, ‘maintenant’ amplifies the thematics of time, of course, but also inspires readings, such as Glenn Fetzer’s study that focus on the nowness of the poetic text, both with respect to its indexical function (as an embrayeur: by saying ‘now,’ the text orients the reader in time) and with respect to its performative force and the possibility that a poetic text operates not only within time but on time, so to speak, establishing the present moment even as it points to it and enacting utterance as a perpetuated moment. Similarly, as a verb, maintenant undescores Guillevic’s conviction that the poem, our ordinary and poetic gestures, and our time all require some maintenance, and more importantly perhaps, that this maintenance is the shared responsibility of reader and poetic text. This collection holds together firmly around its core word, and it is also as rich and varied as the function of that word in Guillevic’s poetry. Reed College (OR) Hugh Hochman Buclin, Hadrien. Maurice Blanchot ou l’autonomie littéraire. Lausanne: Antipodes, 2011. ISBN 978-2-88901-058-5. Pp. 125. 18 a. This study attempts to approach Blanchot, the figure and his work, within the framework of a “sociologie de la culture” (11) inspired by Bourdieu (whose Les règles de l’art is cited several times). Its primary objectives are to situate Blanchot within the literary field of post-war France, and to contextualize—historically, institutionally, and discursively—the work of a writer known for what Buclin calls a “posture du retrait” (10), while also providing readings of Blanchot’s criticism and fiction from this period, insofar as they appear to reflect Blanchot’s strategies for negotiating these contexts. Buclin starts with the notion that Blanchot’s work is animated by “l’exigence d’une ‘littérature pure’, la revendication d’une autonomie radicale de la littérature face aux contextes biographique, sociale et historique” (9). The equivalence between Blanchot and this attitude, expressed in the book’s title, demands to be called into question— not least by Blanchot’s own writing,which often problematizes the autonomy it appears to vindicate. One would be grateful for a careful, rigorous, and non-reductive reading 222 FRENCH REVIEW 87.2 Reviews 223 of Blanchot and his context that would analyze the complex relationship between a writer’s work and his historical circumstances, and that would do justice to a corpus so deliberately paradoxical and self-contradictory as Blanchot’s. Buclin’s study fails to do this. Its virtues lie rather in its presentation of the post-war literary scene in Paris and of the “rapports de force” (13) that determined the landscape in which Blanchot found himself confronted with a delicate situation. The focus on the 1940s brings into relief Blanchot’s shifting political and literary positions, as he moves from right-wing journalism of the 1930s into literary criticism, and as accounts are settled in postOccupation Paris. Blanchot was not among the most compromised writers then, but he did write for a collaborationist journal, and his pre-war stances and alliances on the right were well known.

,La question de la nomination dans l’œuvre de Maurice Blanchot,Anca Călin,,2013,2013-10-17,,,dissertation,fr,,"Qu’est-ce que lire ? Qu’est-ce qu’ecrire ? Ou plus generalement, qu’est-ce que la litterature et comment se ‘fabrique’-t-elle ? Ce sont les questions qui obsedent Maurice Blanchot et auxquelles il tente de repondre. Ce questionnement incessant le conduit a construire un espace litteraire pour interroger la question de la nomination, concept-cle de son œuvre.Notre these se propose de faire la genealogie de cette question du processus de nomination dans l’œuvre de Maurice Blanchot et de reflechir sur l’espace litteraire qu’elle met au jour. Nous insisterons tout particulierement sur le rapport lecteur-ecrivain a travers la difference entre langage ordinaire et langage litteraire.Nous comprenons la lecture et l’ecriture, non pas comme des actes mecaniques de redaction et de dechiffrage de mots, mais comme deux processus intellectuels qui rendent possible ce que nous appellerons dans notre travail l’impossible nomination chez Blanchot. En fait, la lecture et l’ecriture comme actes litteraires ne servent pas a comprendre, exprimer et influencer le monde, le but declare du langage ordinaire ; elles ont plutot pour mission de reflechir sur la prose du monde, sorte de but dissimule du langage litteraire. Blanchot construit ainsi tout son systeme conceptuel a partir de l’opposition entre le langage ordinaire (la langue comme outil) et le langage litteraire (le corps de la langue et sa fabrication comme acte de creation). Et c’est a partir de ce point central que nous articulons notre projet general : comment la matiere brute de la langue conduit a fabriquer la litterature, ce qui revient a interroger le lire et l’ecrire en litterature finalement ?",Humanities | Nomination | Art | Philosophy | Political science | Law,https://openalex.org/W88417621,0.0,,OpenAlex,15

Dans l'un ou l'autre de ses ouvrages, l'abstraction du langage devient paradoxalement le genre suprême de la qualité concrète, en peinture aussi bien qu'en littérature, de sa praxis.

Entre les années 1910 et 1913, l'aporie de la modernité conduit rapidement à la formulation de l'idée de la mort de l'art et, après la deuxième guerre mondiale, avec l'apparition de L'Espace littéraire de Blanchot, cette même aporie amène à engager la littérature dans l'expérience des limites.

10.21992/t9hs64,Translation and Response between Maurice Blanchot and Lydia Davis,Jonathan Evans,,2013,2013-04-02,TranscUlturAl A Journal of Translation and Cultural Studies,University of Alberta Libraries,article,en,False,"When an author translates a text by another writer, this translation is one form of a response to that text. Other responses may appear in their own writings that are more inflected with their authorial persona. Lydia Davis translated six books by Maurice Blanchot, including fiction and theoretical writings. Blanchot’s concept of the récit privileges non-conventional forms of narrative and it can be considered to have influenced Davis, a view shared in critical writing about Davis. However, responses to his fiction can also be found in Davis’s work. This article reads Lydia Davis’s story “Story” as a response to Maurice Blanchot’s récit, La Folie du jour, translated by Davis as “The Madness of the Day”. Both texts develop a narrative that questions the possibility of arriving at a single story: Blanchot’s narrator cannot tell the story of how he came to have glass ground into his eyes, while Davis’s narrator must try to understand a contradictory story told to her by her lover. However, Davis responds to Blanchot by reversing the perspective in the story: where Blanchot’s narrator must and cannot create a story that explains his situation in a judicial/medical context, Davis’s narrator is struggling to understand her lover’s story which does not explain the situation that they find themselves in. Davis’s narrator is therefore motivated by an emotional need to find an acceptable story that is absent from Blanchot’s narrator. This difference in motivation is central to the difference between Davis’s and Blanchot’s approach, and complicates any reading of his influence on her because she responds to his text in her own.",Archaeology | Art | Context (archaeology) | History | Humanities | Literature | Narrative | Persona | Perspective (graphical) | Philosophy | Psychoanalysis | Psychology | Visual arts,https://openalex.org/W1781919425,1.0,,"Crossref, OpenAlex",15

O espaco – nocao fundamental para Blanchot – e, assim, o lugar do errância, do equivoco e da incerteza, sendo a sua melhor metafora representada pelo topografo do romance O castelo, de Kafka, que talvez tenha oferecido a Blanchot o ponto de partida e a sintese concreta do seu pensamento.",Philosophy | Humanities,https://openalex.org/W1564628798,0.0,,OpenAlex,15

Blanchot, al describir el tiempo de la escritura como el tiempo de lo interminable, de lo incesante, de la ausencia o del afuera de tiempo, indica que la escritura permite una experiencia y abre a una comprensión alternativas del tiempo. Dentro de los estudios que componen este volumen, destaca un texto inédito de Jean-Luc Nancy, un escrito de Étienne Balibar y una conversación entre ambos autores. Además, se incluyen trabajos que examinan las reflexiones de Blanchot sobre la temporalidad, prestando especial atención a sus contribuciones más teóricas, y estudios que se centran principalmente en los propios relatos de Blanchot, explorando este espacio narrativo como un terreno para comprender la temática temporal.

This demonstrates the aesthetic effect theory proposed by Wolfgang Iser in his major book The Act of Reading. Maurice Blanchot also intended numerous reflections on the reader in  The Space of Literature, but its position can be confused with a kind of essentialism. This article explores the intimate relationships between the postulates of both thinkers, although belong to different fields and their theories are enrolled in distinct contexts. Hence it is exploring various terms in common in the light of the similarities between: the figure of the circle when reading, taken from Heidegger, and Iser’s “mobile point of view” regarding the “essential solitude” of Blanchot, images and representations and the concept of negativity. All these correlations make us attend to the theories of these writers as dynamic postulates that do not close the reflection around the complex problem of the reader at both of the literary studies and philosophy.

,Maurice Blanchot et la question de l'image,Riccardo Rinaldi,,2019,2019-03-23,,,dissertation,fr,,"La plupart des approches philosophiques de l’œuvre de Maurice Blanchot ont reserve jusqu’a present une place marginale a la question de l’image. A partir de L’Espace litteraire (1955), pourtant, l’image assume un statut theorique nous permettant de l’apprehender comme la matrice d’une ecriture, d’abord partagee entre fiction et critique, qui trouve enfin dans la fragmentation son essor le plus naturel.
Loin d’embrasser un nihilisme sterile, Blanchot degage de la reflexion sur l’œuvre d’art de Heidegger l’idee d’une apparition en tant que disparition, d’une forme invalidant la distinction entre matiere et forme, d’une presence qui n’est pas donnee : presence d’une absence. Il en tire une vision radicalement antihumaniste, bien plus coherente que la conception de l’evenement scandant l’histoire des epoques de l’Etre : venant avant la chose, l’image condamne la conscience du sujet metaphysique en tant que scene exclusive de toute representation. Le visage de la mort devient le paradigme du regard aveugle que les choses portent sur nous. La litterature se revele alors preliminaire a une vision autre, qui touche a ce qui precede l’existence de l’homme dans sa globalite, sa finitude s’eparpillant en une approche sans fin de la fin.

Manchester, UK: The University of                    Manchester; 2011.",,dissertation,en,,"AbstractThe University of ManchesterHossein MoradiDoctor of PhilosophyMay 2011Writing and the Other: Franz Kafka and Maurice BlanchotThis thesis attempts to explore what occurs in the act of writing; arguing that the act of writing opens a space for 'the other.' For this argument, I bring Franz Kafka who has remained unthought in terms of the act of writing in the deconstructive thinking close to Maurice Blanchot who writes both theoretical discussion and fiction specifically on the act of writing. Blanchot has written extensively on Kafka; his r�cits also are influenced by Kafka. In the introduction, I argue through Borges and Benjamin that Kafka and Blanchot create their past and future, so that we understand any text in the past or the future differently if we know them. In other words, works are in dialogue with one another. This creativity is actually being open to 'the other.' Chapter one argues that Blanchot criticizes language for making things absent by representing them. For him, writing should be the act of making space between word and its referent in order that the referent shows itself infinitely. This spacing, for Blanchot, is desoeuvrement or worklessness as an undoing of being, the neutral spacing that let the thing's otherness come infinitely. The second chapter argues that Joseph K. in The Castle is exposed to this spacing or desoeuvrement which makes him and the castle distance from their meaning and find the singular possibilities of their unknown nature as 'the other' infinitely. Blanchot's meaning of literature necessitates dealing with the notion of the author. In this sense, the third chapter argues that when Kafka is metamorphosed into writing he loses his identity. Writing, for Kafka, becomes the space in which he loses his sense of selfhood and sees 'the other' in the self. Chapter four, by reading Blanchot?s The Instant of My Death and Kafka?s Metamorphosis, argues that being exposed to ?the other? in writing necessitates the process of dying, not death as one instant that begins and ends. Writing becomes the process that interrupts the border between life and death. The self gets no determination, completion, and totality and at the same time it will not be reducible to disappearance. My fifth and sixth chapters illustrate what Blanchot?s means in writing a r�cit. Chapter five argues that the r�cit as a concept questions memory as the place of passed past experiences. In memory, the past, the present and the future become the 'extended present' which means memory is the place in which neither remembering nor forgetting happens. The r�cit rejects memory as the fixed narrative of the past. Therefore, the r�cit is the open space with the possibility of inventing 'the other.' Chapter six argues that the recit is the place where opens the Freud's primal scene to the prior scenes endlessly which are not located in the past; they also occur in the future. By this futurity, he leaves the space for 'the other' in the past and the future. The seventh chapter illustrates Kafka's The Trial while thinking of the concept of the r�cit. The text has no pre-existent story as its origin and problematizes the concept of repetition. By removing the originary state and teleological existence, the text is open to 'the other,' the new possibilities of being written and read endlessly. The conclusion as well as further discussing what ?the other? is and how writing lets it come propose that the ethics of writing in Kafka and Blanchot is not limited only to the openness of the self to 'the other;' it also brings out the community which prepares itself for the coming of 'the other.'",Referent | Undoing | Meaning (existential) | Argument (complex analysis) | Philosophy | Order (exchange) | Space (punctuation) | Literature | Epistemology | Linguistics | Art | Psychoanalysis | Psychology | Biochemistry | Chemistry | Finance | Economics,https://openalex.org/W118160867,0.0,,OpenAlex,15

Esa modificación, sostenemos, por último, (3) contiene un desplazamiento en el fundamento del concepto: el concepto de DI ya no tiene por base el ámbito de las facultades subjetivas (i.e. el ‘juicio de gusto’), sino el ámbito del arte y del lenguaje.

The second, existentialism, might be able to bring their works together, especially through the way they treat the subject of suicide, focussing on Blanchot’s The Space of Literature and Cioran’s On the Heights of Despair.

Cette notion interroge depuis toujours le rapport qu’entretiennent les hommes avec la nature comme puissance d’engendrement du vivant et comme principe regulateur et normatif. Rapportee au langage, la monstruosite suggere, apres le traumatisme de la guerre et du genocide des Juifs, une angoisse collective quant a la rationalisation des phenomenes « naturels » ou « culturels ». Le risque est que le signe, quel qu’il soit, devienne un fetiche, le pretexte a un spectacle ou l’artifice regne sans bornes. Le signe-monstre, au lieu de designer un referent du monde exterieur sans s’y substituer, prend corps dans le reel en n’indiquant plus que sa propre surface, sa propre image ; il devient un artefact, une construction artificielle autonome et inquietante. Une generation d'ecrivains (Samuel Beckett, Maurice Blanchot, Albert Camus, Louis-Rene des Forets) concoit ainsi son rapport au langage par rapport aux atrocites de la Seconde Guerre mondiale. Pouvoir, manipulation et propagande apparaissent comme des termes cles pour les ecrivains apres 1945 qui ne cessent de dramatiser la prise de parole, percue comme une menace et une violence qu'il faut necessairement dejouer. Les recits d’apres-guerre ont pour trait commun de chercher a apprehender le fonctionnement rhetorique et formel des systemes signifiants : leur forme meme integre une inquietude qui les conduit a mimer le phenomene de contagion redoute ou a « epuiser » leur capacite a produire du sens. Cette sensibilite aux derives ideologiques et a la logique des discours incite aussi ces auteurs a surmarquer les manques, les insuffisances de leurs recits, et les limites du langage qu’ils deploient. Nous tracons la voie pour une redefinition de l'ecriture de fiction apres la guerre, ni formaliste, ni engagee, au sens de Sartre, mais consciente des enjeux d'une epoque ou tout est a reconstruire. Afin d’apprivoiser la propension du langage a la « contre-nature », l’ecrivain tardif adopte une posture d’equilibriste : conscient que son langage n’est pas epargne par la charge de violence qui traverse l’epoque, il en eprouve les dangers et les limites, a l’interieur de formes nouvelles et restreintes.",Humanities | Philosophy | Art,https://openalex.org/W3186187484,0.0,,OpenAlex,15

I then establish Blanchot’s unique ontological depiction of the artwork as useless and impossible through the philosophical foundations of Aristotle, Hegel, and Heidegger on potentiality (dunamis), work (Arbeit), and technology (Technik) respectively. Since Blanchot considers his artwork to be evidence of an essentially political refusal, I consider Blanchot under the guise of political ontology. By narrating the roles of impossibility, refusal, the absence of work (desoeuvrement), and death in Blanchot’s theory of art as literature, I show how we can derive a new politics from the artwork.",Impossibility | Ontology | Politics | Hegelianism | Depiction | Epistemology | Power (physics) | Philosophy | Political philosophy | Political science | Law | Linguistics | Physics | Quantum mechanics,https://openalex.org/W2596516529,0.0,,OpenAlex,15

,"An application of Maurice Blanchot's notion of modern literature : to an analyses of P.B. Shelley's Alastor, Julian and Maddalo and The triumph of life",Sylvie Gautheron,,2003,2003-01-01,,,dissertation,en,,"The thesis considers the parallel critiques of the notion of poesis as a mode of subjective power of self-determination in P.B. Shelley and Maurice Blanchot. It explores the terms in which, in the romantic-idealist tradition, the work of art is valorised as the realisation of the subject's access to spiritual significance. The thesis traces one of the sources of Blanchot's notion of modern literature' to his understanding of romanticism. It describes the ways in which Blanchot's notion of the non-romantic essence of romanticism deconstructs the romantic-idealist model of the work of literature as a mode of subjective self-realisation. Blanchot focuses on the fact that the presence of the critique of this model within the romantic/idealist theorization of the work of literature turns literature into a self-questioning, rather than a self-realizing structure. The idealist framework offers a notion of absolute reflection which significantly extends the model/figure of the autonomous subject. The thesis will argue that, on the evidence of some of Shelley’s prose fragments, the empiricist and sceptical heritage of Shelley' s conception of the mind draws him away from subscribing to such a model, and ultimately leads him to repeal it. The thesis will also argue that a similar undermining of the individual integrity of the subject can be observed in Shelley’s conception of self-identity. The analysis undertaken in the thesis concentrates on how a distinction between the ability to realize the poetical work and a process of self-realization is manifested in the three poems selected for scrutiny, and how this problematic is developed through the individual imaginative quest embodied in the figure of the poet in Alastor. The thesis will also explore the ways in which the ambivalence of the articulations around which the world of sanity and the notion of the accomplished work of literature are organized and dramatized in Julian and Maddalo. The Triumph of Life is then contrasted with the theme of the representative relation of the poet in concord to his community that is offered in A Defence of Poetry.

Paul Auster's influence of Maurice Blanchot's poetics starts with Auster's experience as a translator of some of Blanchot's texts, a job that contributes to the influence French literature has in Auster's work. I argue that Paul Auster's Moon Palace fictionalizes Maurice Blanchot's literary theory by introducing a central character, Marco Fogg, who implicitly performs the role of character-author and progressively transforms himself and his own world into a fictional one. In order to accomplish this task, Auster leads his central character to different stages of inspiration and creation comparable to the ones defined by Blanchot in his theorization of the literary space. Whereas most of the critics point at isolation and hunger as a rebellious behavior provoked by the existential crisis of the character, I analyze them as creative stages in the protagonist's fictional transformation. By introducing this creative process in his fiction, Auster creates a particular Austerian metafiction in which characters become the protagonists, creators and readers of their own urban fictional space.",Art | Character (mathematics) | Epistemology | Existentialism | Geometry | Linguistics | Literature | Mathematics | Philosophy | Poetics | Poetry | Reading (process) | Solitude,https://openalex.org/W4390542485,0.0,,OpenAlex,14

This is pursued by a close examination of how the theoretical text could have been interpreted in a series of works that ostensibly do not share the overt scenarios of the Sadean imagination but in their relation to interaction and media sustain an operative sense of Blanchot's account.
This interpretation is considered within the broader historical and intellectual context of theory in France and in the USA, and how although French Theory became a major element of art discourse in the US in the 1970s there are significant lacunae when it comes to a commentary on this particular artist's work. Through the interpretation of Acconci's work and his reading of Blanchot a connection is made between its political dimension and the philosophical anarchism that has been a vital strand of French literary theory; the latter has been an ongoing theme in Continental philosophy over the past decade.",Interpretation (philosophy) | Theme (computing) | Context (archaeology) | Reading (process) | The arts | Politics | Literary theory | Art | Art history | Humanities | Literature | Philosophy | Aesthetics | History | Literary criticism | Law | Visual arts | Political science | Linguistics | Archaeology | Computer science | Operating system,https://openalex.org/W1892491051,0.0,,OpenAlex,14

The aim of this refection is to trace out the limits of the subject who utters ‘I’ and the principles of its reality, which Lacan in his seminar L’éthique de la psychanalyse characterizes as “essentially precarious”. It will be argued that the exposure to such precariousness of reality may cause a certain ‘reversal of the mirror stage,’ which strips the subject of its ability to speak in the frst person singular. Moreover, it is suggested that indications of such a reversal may be found at certain limit points of Lacan’s psychoanalytic discourse at which it brushes up against Maurice Blanchot’s writing of the neuter. In pursuit of these liminal points, the main body of the essay is divided into three sections each of which takes as its point of departure three key sentences from Lacan’s tenth seminar L’angoisse (1962-1963). The efort is to bring each of these sentences into a conversation (infnite no doubt) with diferent aspects of Blanchot’s writing of the neuter as these are put forward mainly in his L’espace littéraire (1955).

,"Blanchot, Derrida, Gadamer and the anarchy of style",Mario Aquilina,,2012,2012-01-01,,,dissertation,en,,"This dissertation examines the possibilities of thinking and reading style nonteleocratically through the work of Hans-Georg Gadamer, Maurice Blanchot, and Jacques Derrida. The title evokes the non-foundational aspect of style—style as that which is not conceptualisable and which defies categorisation by previously established rules. Chapter 1 shows how traditional theories and definitions of style are essentially teleocratic in being always directed towards some external function. Style is considered as a signifier of social, biographical or political signifieds, or else it is discussed as a representation of linguistic, generic, formal, or cognitive structures. Style as an event, on the other hand, cannot be fully understood theoretically but must be encountered always singularly and in performance. Style as an event does not simply represent something that exists before it but creates the possibilities of its readability. Style is then also anachronic, suspending teleocratic conceptions of the temporality of style in terms of original and more essential sources. It is oriented towards the future, the aleatory, that which is always still to come. Chapters 2, 3, and 4 explore the subject through successive, focused discussions of the thinking and performance of style in Gadamer’s, Blanchot’s, and Derrida’s work. Each chapter finishes with a discussion of the respective thinker’s encounter with Paul Celan’s poetry, which, it is argued, demands non-teleocratic readings. For comparative purposes, in Chapter 5, these readings are contrasted to teleocratic theories of style by Fredric Jameson and by various contemporary stylisticians. What results from this comparison is not a new method to be applied in an improved theory of style but an ethical consideration of the singularity of every reading of style marked by moments of interruption and intensification that arise in the performance of style.",Style (visual arts) | Temporality | Representation (politics) | Subject (documents) | Philosophy | Epistemology | Poetry | Reading (process) | Event (particle physics) | Politics | Literature | Art | Linguistics | Computer science | Physics | Quantum mechanics | Library science | Political science | Law,https://openalex.org/W1481474546,0.0,,OpenAlex,14

A Case Study on Death Sentence and Awaiting Oblivion (II),Arleen Ionescu,,2023,2023-12-30,Philologica Jassyensia,,article,en,False,"This article investigates a type of narrative that is unacknowledged by classical narratology and hardly included in postclassical narratology studies: that of lyrical and philosophical prose, often containing elements belonging to the dramatic genre. Starting from Brian McHale’s urge to address Monika Fludernik’s exclusion of poeticity from narratology and Jan Alber’s inclusion of any poem in narrativity, I use different definitions and clarifications from classical and postclassical narratology (Vladimir Propp, Greimas, Roland Barthes, Shlomith Rimmon-Kenan, Sarah Drews Lucas, Gerald Prince, James Phelan, Peter Hühn, Jens Kiefer, Hanna Meretoja, Rachel Blau DuPlessis, John Shoptaw, Samuel Caleb Wee, Roy Sommer, Manfred Jahn, Roland Weidle), also bringing elements on agency from drama (via Martin Esslin’s notion of the “Theater of the Absurd”) in order to find the best tools to explain how Blanchot’s Death Sentence and Awaiting Oblivion elude narrative agency. On the one hand, these récits challenge the usual borders between literature and philosophy and, on the other hand, they refuse taxonomic boundaries such as what we understand by literary genres. Thus, my article focuses on the lack of narrative agency in these texts, a notion that is paradoxically connected to the affirmation of passion and passivity, which characterizes the experience of literature and death alike, often in the form of the neuter. I relate Blanchot’s neuter to Emmanuel Levinas’s il y a and I discuss the formula “X without X” as not purely privative but as a pre-critical notion which Blanchot used in order to emphasize the divide passion/passivity/action/activity. While in my discussion of Death Sentence, I define the unnarratable and the difference between the two stories that make it up, completing each other and taking the reader from the realm of life to the realm of death and back to life, in the section on Awaiting Oblivion, I deal with the philosophical language and dramatic devices of the text.

10.1353/sub.2017.0034,“The Authenticity of Exile” between Blanchot and Levinas,Michael Krimper,,2017,2017-01-01,SubStance,,article,en,False,"“The Authenticity of Exile” between Blanchot and Levinas Michael Krimper (bio) If there is, among all words, one that is inauthentic, then surely it is the word “authentic.” (Blanchot, The Writing of Disaster 60) In 1956, Emmanuel Levinas devoted a provocative essay to the writing of his friend and companion in thought, Maurice Blanchot, entitled “The Poet’s Vision.” Therein, Levinas closely examines Blanchot’s meditations on the origin and essence of the literary work, focusing in particular on the collection of essays assembled together in the book The Space of Literature, which appeared one year beforehand in 1955. His contention, broadly speaking, is that Blanchot’s literary criticism and fiction does not reduce “the limit of the human” to the domain of possibility (“Vision” 127). Instead, it places into question the definition of human being in terms of the “I can,” whereby the subject exercises power over the object, gaining mastery over things, words, and others in the world. One could say that Blanchot thus contests the dialectical view, as received at least in part from Alexandre Kojève’s famous lectures on Hegel in the 1930s, according to which humanity gradually produces and realizes itself by means of undertaking an enormous effort to negate nature, comprehend the other, and transform the entirety of the given in the course of Western history.1 At odds with this dialectical account of the human as possibility, Blanchot interrogates the impossibility underlying a certain strand of modern art and literature. His writing, Levinas tells us, tends to delve into an experience of a singular artwork or literary work in which the search for the absolute (the total work) inevitably encounters the impossible and ungraspable source of its existence. That source defies all powers of negativity, every disclosure of meaning, frustrating the limits of the work as a whole. This is because the work’s “way of being,” Levinas specifies, “consists in being present without being given, in not delivering itself up to the powers, since negation has been the ultimate human power, in being the domain of the impossible, on which power can get no purchase, in [End Page 105] being a perpetual dismissal of the one who discloses it” (131). Blanchot, for his part, occasionally puts the non-dialectical movement whereby the work disrupts the labor of the negative and comes undone under the sign of désoeuvrement—an untranslatable concept rendered approximately into English as “unworking” or “worklessness,” along with other terms that loosely designate “inoperativity.” By enacting the inoperative operation of désoeuvrement, the work brings about its own absolute dissolution and fragmentation. That is, the work lays bare nothing but the non-foundation or “error” out of which it unfurls and into which it collapses. And though Levinas does not deploy the term désoeuvrement in this regard, he similarly demonstrates how the work under question for Blanchot draws from a measureless reserve of inaction and passivity whose impossibility refuses the mastery of the human subject. According to Levinas, this procedure would introduce another “category” for philosophy, along with a new “way of knowing” (133).2 Apart from dialectics, Levinas considers, moreover, whether Blanchot’s literary research of the error might consist in undermining the enclosure of Heidegger’s ontology in its widest sense. Levinas raises this question at multiple junctures in his essay, “Does Blanchot not attribute to art the function of uprooting the Heideggerian universe?” “Does not the poet,” he asks again, “hear the voices that call away from the Heideggerian world?” (127). As far as Levinas is concerned, Heidegger’s view of authenticity in particular implies how his thought remains caught within the same totalizing logic that reduces the limit of the human to possibility (capacity, power, and mastery). Blanchot, by contrast, signals another source for authenticity, no longer within the possibility of appropriating one’s own death, but its impossibility; no longer within the founding act of disclosing the truth of being in the world, but within the foundering act of error; no longer within the enrootedness of poetic dwelling either, but within the uprootedness of poetic exile. “And yet it is in this nontrue to which literature leads,” Levinas asserts, “and not in...",Aesthetics | Art | Computer science | Criticism | Dialectic | Epistemology | Hegelianism | Humanity | Impossibility | Law | Library science | Linguistics | Literature | Object (grammar) | Philosophy | Physics | Political science | Power (physics) | Psychoanalysis | Psychology | Quantum mechanics | Subject (documents) | Theology,https://openalex.org/W4300584930,0.0,,OpenAlex,14

A Case Study on Death Sentence and Awaiting Oblivion (I),Arleen Ionescu,,2023,2023-06-28,Philologica Jassyensia,,article,en,False,"This article investigates a type of narrative that is unacknowledged by classical narratology and hardly included in postclassical narratology studies: that of lyrical and philosophical prose, often containing elements belonging to the dramatic genre. Starting from Brian McHale’s urge to address Monika Fludernik’s exclusion of poeticity from narratology and Jan Alber’s inclusion of any poem in narrativity, I use different definitions and clarifications from classical and postclassical narratology (Vladimir Propp, Greimas, Roland Barthes, Shlomith Rimmon-Kenan, Sarah Drews Lucas, Gerald Prince, James Phelan, Peter Hühn, Jens Kiefer, Hanna Meretoja, Rachel Blau DuPlessis, John Shoptaw, Samuel Caleb Wee, Roy Sommer, Manfred Jahn, Roland Weidle), also bringing elements on agency from drama (via Martin Esslin’s notion of the “Theater of the Absurd”) in order to find the best tools to explain how Blanchot’s Death Sentence and Awaiting Oblivion elude narrative agency. On the one hand, these récits challenge the usual borders between literature and philosophy and, on the other hand, they refuse taxonomic boundaries such as what we understand by literary genres. Thus, my article focuses on the lack of narrative agency in these texts, a notion that is paradoxically connected to the affirmation of passion and passivity, which characterizes the experience of literature and death alike, often in the form of the neuter. I relate Blanchot’s neuter to Emmanuel Levinas’s il y a and I discuss the formula “X without X” as not purely privative but as a pre-critical notion which Blanchot used in order to emphasize the divide passion/passivity/action/activity. While in my discussion of Death Sentence, I define the unnarratable and the difference between the two stories that make it up, completing each other and taking the reader from the realm of life to the realm of death and back to life, in the section on Awaiting Oblivion, I deal with the philosophical language and dramatic devices of the text. With a preamble on its themes: waiting, forgetting, and speaking continuously (or “blathering”, to use Samuel Beckett’s term), I finally put Awaiting Oblivion in relation to Beckett’s Waiting for Godot.",Agency (philosophy) | Art | Drama | Epistemology | Literature | Narrative | Narrativity | Narratology | Philosophy,https://openalex.org/W4385078599,0.0,,OpenAlex,14

An examination of Khatibi’s theoretical strategies as a politically committed writer reveal his aim to articulate the multifarious nature of Maghreb identity freed from the unitary and universalizing notions of national and cultural identity inherent in Western metaphysics and Arab-Islamic culture. These well-studied strategies structure his novel, Amour bilingue, although it is Blanchot’s significant influence on the novel that has eluded critics in the past.

Robertson,,2007,2007-03-01,James Joyce quarterly,,article,en,False,"Reviewed by: Romantic Poetry and the Fragmentary Imperative: Schlegel, Byron, Joyce, Blanchot Ben P. Robertson (bio) Romantic Poetry and the Fragmentary Imperative: Schlegel, Byron, Joyce, Blanchot by Christopher A. StrathmanAlbany: State University of New York Press, 2006. xii + 204 pp. $60.00. Christopher A. Strathman's Romantic Poetry and the Fragmentary Imperative will be of interest to Joyce scholars because it offers a useful means of reading Joyce's fragmentary work and because it treats that work as a vital link in an evolving continuum of literary theory and practice. Strathman uses the ideas of the poetic fragment and fragmentary writing to advance a compelling argument which links theories of German Romantic poetry with modernist literature and modern literary theory. His stated objective is ""to sketch a genealogy of fragmentary work from romanticism to Joyce and, with important qualifications, Blanchot"" (26). Strathman begins his discussion with Friedrich Schlegel's concept of ""romantische Poesie,""1 traces its influence on Lord Byron, finds echoes of the idea in Ulysses, and then suggests the further development of the notion in Maurice Blanchot's theories of fragmentary writing.2 Strathman defines Schlegel's romantische Poesie as a ""call for a new and highly self-conscious literary work that embodies the fractured, decentered consciousness of ancient philosophical dialogue"" (1). Indeed, one of Strathman's most important points is that any fragmentary writing—not just poetry—creates the same kind of exigency as does Socratic dialogue. A monologue establishes a rhetorical situation in which information is passed in one direction, and this type of situation implies that the thought process behind the discourse is complete. In contrast, a dialogue invites participation, interruption, contradiction, digression; as a consequence, it is inherently fragmentary. Moreover, its disjunctive nature fosters additional thought about the subject at hand. Strathman is interested in how the fragmented-ness of a literary work—whether the work itself is a fragment or whether it is fragmentary—creates different kinds of dialogue and thus encourages continued thought. The dialogue itself need not be [End Page 623] between characters but may be between genres, between theory and practice, or between philosophy and poetry. In Strathman's view, for example, Romantic poetry is ""a hybrid genre that moves unpredictably back and forth between theory and practice; it exhibits both philosophical and literary, narrative and lyrical dimensions, and it contains both transparent and opaquely self-critical moments"" (2). The true power of the fragmentary work is in its invitation to the reader to move forward, to ""traverse the world with the humility of a desert thinker or an exile rather than a debater (who, after all, desires to win) or an officially anointed poet laureate"" (5). Strathman calls this invitation the ""fragmentary imperative"" and argues that it ""underwrites much of what usually counts as romanticism"" (5). Strathman's introductory chapter is somewhat dense, especially since it moves rather quickly from one theorist to the next as he establishes the key points of his argument. Indeed, at times, the introduction exhibits an almost mimetic similarity to the fragmentary works it discusses, but if the chapter bristles with theorists, it does so only because Strathman has done exemplary research to ground his own work. Subsequent chapters are more narrowly focused and clearly follow the line of reasoning established in the introduction. In his discussion of Schlegel, Strathman borrows from Blanchot to elaborate on the idea of the fragmentary imperative as ""a persistent unsettling of intellectual and artistic territories and ideological positions"" (31).3 Because it destabilizes readers' assumptions, fragmentary writing prolongs the thought process. As Strathman comments, ""[c]omplete comprehension (with no remainder) leaves nothing more to be said and so ends a relationship, while endless interpretation, philosophical friendship, has two sides, and so preserves the open-ended (unpredictable) encounter between reader and text"" (41). For Schlegel—and Blanchot—lack of understanding is a logical and necessary stage through which a reader must blunder because too ready a comprehension on a reader's part truncates the thought process. Indeed, complete comprehension may be undesirable in some cases. Strathman interprets Byron's work, especially Don Juan and Childe Harold's Pilgrimage, as rejection of ""poetry masquerading as metaphysics; poetry as a form...",Argument (complex analysis) | Art | Biochemistry | Chemistry | Literature | Philosophy | Poetics | Poetry | Rhetorical question | Romance | Romanticism,https://openalex.org/W2070048041,0.0,,OpenAlex,14

All beginnings are difficult. The beginning, as far as this paper is concerned, perhaps like all beginnings, was an unexpected encounter, an event, a chance moment when the author of these lines (not for the first time, but as though it were the first time) came across a brief sixteen-word fragment from Maurice Blanchot's Le Pas au-delà [The Step Not Beyond], a fragment that, in all senses of the word, appealed to him—and to me. That fragment is as follows: ◆ A hand outstretched, refused, which, in whatever manner, we would not be able to grasp. This dense yet incisive text, as I have sought to argue elsewhere, points in many different directions: towards philosophy (Heraclitus, Hegel, Heidegger, Bataille), towards politics (the events of May 1968 in Paris), and towards that writing that, perhaps ironically, but with enduring persistence, Blanchot continued till the end to address as literature or poetry.2 Under this last rubric, I want to suggest that what Blanchot's fragment also evokes, among others—discreetly, cryptically, ungraspably—is the writing of Paul Celan, that poet of undecidable nationality (Romanian by birth, German by language, French by adoption) whose outstretched hand, refusing itself or refused, at any [End Page 986] event not grasped, was extended for one last time perhaps on the evening of April 19, 1970, shortly before the poet's death by drowning—by his own hand—some three and a half years before the publi-cation of Le Pas au-delà.3 Celan's death, as convention demands, was an occasion both for mourning and for celebration alike. As such, it brought together in 1972, within the pages of a memorial issue of La Revue de Belles-Lettres, two lifelong friends, joined in their many differences and separated in their constant accord: Maurice Blanchot and Emmanuel Levinas, each of whom contributed an essay on Celan to the journal. ""De l'être à l'autre [From Being to the Other],"" Levinas titled his piece; ""Le Dernier à parler [The Last To Speak],"" Blanchot wrote alongside.4 These titles say much. They show that, in remembering Celan, both Blanchot and Levinas were endeavouring to respond, each in his own idiom, to an event—event without event, perhaps—affecting not only the possibility and impossibility of a singular existence, what Celan at one point calls ""a unique, mortal existence, who with both voice and silence seeks a path,""5 but also the possibility and impossibility of poetry itself, in other words: its future. Not as revelation, destiny, or truth, but as an encounter, announced, affirmed, and underwritten in the words of another. As we shall see, everything turns on this question of translation and citation. II Let me first hand over to Levinas, the elder by nearly two years. Levinas begins his tribute to Celan with a well-known quotation, taken from a letter to Hans Bender in May 1960, in which the poet explains his reasons for not contributing an essay on his own poems to the anthology Bender was preparing. ""Once the poem is really there [wirklich da],"" Celan argued, ""the poet is released from his original involvement in it.""6 Commentary, then, is not the prerogative of the poet. But in refusing to participate in Bender's project, Celan was not appealing to established assumptions about aesthetic autonomy. What his gesture betokened instead was more a kind of radical generosity. Poems, Celan explains later in the same letter, are also gifts, ""gifts to whoever is paying attention [Geschenke an die Aufmerksamen]."" ""I see no essential difference,"" he famously added, ""between a handshake and a poem [zwischen Händedruck und Gedicht].""7 [End Page 987] Citing these famous words, in French, at the beginning of his essay, Levinas goes on to offer the following commentary: With one stroke of the pen, the poem, the height of language, is reduced to the level of an interjection, a form of expression as inarticulate as a wink [un clin d'œil], a sign to one's neighbour! A sign of what? Of life [de vie]? Kindness [de bienveillance]? Or complicity?

Para Blanchot, a questão sobre o impoder, inerente ao processo da escrita, é experienciada por Artaud como porvir da obra literária/poética, tais quais as obras de outros autores. Nesse sentido, além de fazer de sua obra o lugar de fala sobre o vazio da própria linguagem, Artaud, para Blanchot, também fundamenta sua busca pela totalidade representativa como um problema essencialmente poético. Em contraposição, Derrida aponta que a compreensão blanchotiana de Artaud, a fim de teorizar o ser da escrita, reduz a singularidade e a unicidade da obra artaudiana comparando-a com as obras de outros autores. Nesse contexto, cria-se um paradoxo em relação à obra de Artaud: Derrida afirma a singularidade da obra artaudiana e o teatro como fundamento para uma ressignificação metafísica da linguagem; Blanchot defende que o problema de Artaud é um problema poético/literário, uma vez que a busca por uma expressão total se estende a todos os momentos da obra de artaudiana, inclusive, a teatral.",Humanities | Philosophy,https://openalex.org/W2950895976,0.0,,OpenAlex,14

These philosophical and literary arguments proceed by examining a series of related concepts: study, sexuality, language, mysticism, and friendship. Despite the fact that Blanchot and Agamben often serve today as primary points of reference for literary theory, no significant critical work has yet examined their works in a sustained dialogue. Hillyer initiates this new trajectory of research through readings of Blanchot's The Unavowable Community and Agamben's The Open, which are followed by encounters with books by contemporary writers Vila-Matas, Aira, and Carson. The juxtaposition of these two different forms of writing (philosophy as literature and literature as philosophy) shows that the new kind of writing analyzed here holds both &quot;literature&quot; and &quot;philosophy&quot; at a certain distance from each other as well as from themselves. The primary means of this distantiation is the gesture of deactivation performed by the act of &quot;study.&quot; The narrators and authors examined here often &quot;study&quot; both literature and philosophy in order to remove them from their perilous metaphysical foundations.

Par <scp>Leslie Hill</scp>,John McKeane,,2021,2021-07-06,French Studies,Liverpool University Press,article,en,False,"In this weighty volume, Leslie Hill undertakes to read Maurice Blanchot's writing from beginning to end, including but by no means limited to the posthumous Chroniques politiques des années trente: 1931–1940, ed. by David Uhrig (Paris: Gallimard, 2017). He also reads and exposits a large amount of material by contemporaries, giving a vivid feeling of the journals and newspapers Blanchot was involved with, both as a contributor and in editorial roles. More than most, Hill's book responds to a context: recent critical accounts of Blanchot's right-wing writings by Uhrig, Jean-Luc Nancy, Michel Surya, Zeev Sternhell, and others. Hill rightly pays attention to Blanchot's student friendship with Emmanuel Levinas, his editorial work alongside Paul Lévy, and the reports on the horrors of Buchenwald printed by Aux Écoutes as early as 1938. He adeptly guides us through a political landscape which confounds many of our assumptions: nationalists argue against war, a Franco-Soviet accord is seen as forestalling any potential agreement between Hitler and the USSR, and the spiritualist right disparages fascism and Nazism. Nonetheless, in Hill's — understandably — defensive account, more time is spent explaining what Blanchot wasn't, than what he was. True, we are told that for some (not all) of his 1930s writing he pursued 'une ligne politique libérale conservatrice relativement classique' (p. 448). But in other, less polemical circumstances, without the need to defend Blanchot against unfounded accusations of having sympathized with fascism or Nazism, this figure's position could have been more overtly laid out. Nonetheless, Hill's detailed account shows that Blanchot was, among other things: a contrarian; a believer in the aristocratic mission of writing and thought; a defender of violence; a co-traveller of the Fédération des contribuables; an adherent of 'révolution nationale' (a phrase later adopted by Pétain); in short, someone who may not even have given E. M. Forster's 'two cheers for democracy'. To those familiar with his work, there is little doubt that he later became — and in drafting his Thomas novels was already becoming — the twentieth century's foremost thinker of the transformative power of language. But holding all this together in our minds has long been the challenge facing Blanchot's readers, and will long remain so. One more feature of Hill's work demands treatment. In Christophe Bident's biography Maurice Blanchot, partenaire invisible (Seyssel: Champ Vallon, 1998), he argued that the few antisemitic references found in Blanchot's 1930s writing were hastily conceived, and soon replaced by his deeper, true thinking. Hill goes one — big — step further. Concerning Blanchot's writings in Combat in 1936, he argues that 'les phrases xénophobes et antisémites de l'article du mois d'avril de ""Blanchot"" ne sont pas de lui. […] [L]e texte de Blanchot a été modifié, c'est-à-dire manipulé et trafiqué par d'autres rédacteurs' (p. 168; my emphasis). Hill supports this argument by evoking editorial practices of the time, as well as a stylistico-ideological incongruity between such phrases and the rest of Blanchot's thinking. But proper proof for such explosive assertions is lacking; it is likely that no definitive proof exists either way. A similar argument is then made for the antisemitic statements found in Blanchot's articles for L'Insurgé in 1937. Hill shifts his weight from one foot to the other, sometimes presenting his argument as a hypothesis, sometimes veritably hammering away at the alleged doubt over authorship. The arguments presented on the statements in Combat and L'Insurgé do not convince this reader. But it will be for each reader to decide whether this is over-reach, or a defence to the hilt of a thinker maligned by our modern need to condemn.",Archaeology | Art | Art history | Context (archaeology) | Friendship | History | Humanities | Law | Literature | Nazism | Philosophy | Political science | Politics | Social science | Sociology,https://openalex.org/W3214978101,1.0,,"Crossref, OpenAlex",14
10.1093/fs/knac225,<i>Illegibility: Blanchot and Hegel</i>. By William S. Allen,Michael Holland,,2022,2022-10-14,French Studies,Liverpool University Press,article,en,False,"This is the latest in a series of books by William S. Allen devoted wholly or partly to Maurice Blanchot’s work. It begins with a clear statement of its guiding principle: ‘a text that is beyond comprehension offers itself to thought in other ways’ (p. 1). This ‘problematic of illegibility’ arises when thought enquires into its own language, and as such it ‘lies at the heart of a certain response to Hegel, particularly that of Blanchot’, for whom it is literature that provides one such ‘other way’ (p. 2). The loss of finitude that results when thinking ‘seeks to come to terms with itself’ exposes the mind to an experience of death and the infinite that philosophy alone cannot comprehend (p. 2). Through the ‘ineradicable linguistic supplement’ provided by literature, Blanchot turns the ‘syncope of language’ that the experience of illegibility induces in thought into ‘an entirely different form of relation’ (p. 5). Having persuasively established a clear relation between the three terms of his title, however, Allen almost immediately abandons it. A chapter on Michel Foucault, Raymond Roussel, and the Comte de Lautréamont, designed to ‘offset’ Blanchot’s understanding of literature and ‘situate the subsequent analysis’ (pp. 10, 15), is followed by one on Jacques Derrida’s reading of Hegel, which begins by contrasting it unfavourably with Blanchot’s but otherwise says little of note about the latter. Then comes a chapter devoted entirely to Hegel and Aufhebung, in which Blanchot only intermittently appears. In the final third of the book Blanchot and Hegel at last become the focus. By that stage, however, the theme of illegibility — the notion that gives the book its title — has almost disappeared from Allen’s argument, having received only a handful of mentions in what precedes. As a result, although it is invoked once or twice with reference to the neutral, to L’Attente l’oubli (1962), and to Theodor Adorno’s approach to artworks or to the reading of texts, illegibility provides the argument with neither direction nor substance, so that the book often appears aimless and digressive. When he focuses closely on Blanchot’s texts, Allen certainly provides some illuminating insights, for example in what he says about ‘the reflexive point of intelligibility’ with which the indexical marks in L’Attente l’oubli mark the moment of reading (p. 179). Too often, however, the telescope swings round to reveal a remote thinker, engaged in a protracted wrangle with abstruse notions and talking primarily to himself. It is disappointing that there is no bibliography, even though the often lengthy notes contain copious references, and referencing in the main text is sometimes allusive, as if it is assumed that the reader’s knowledge of the material being discussed is identical to the author’s. Moreover, the index is partial and quirky: in one case, the author and the title of a single book are listed separately with the same (incomplete) page references, while numerous other authors appear more often in the text than in the index, or are simply not listed there at all.",Art | Computer science | Database | Epistemology | Hegelianism | Linguistics | Literature | Philosophy | Psychoanalysis | Psychology | Reading (process) | Relation (database) | Statement (logic),https://openalex.org/W4306168530,0.0,,"Crossref, OpenAlex",14

These essays, in one way or the other, relate to the Indian context. More than the question of Blanchot’s critical attitude towards the reception of either Mahatma Gandhi or Indian spirituality in the European intellectual milieu, the author attempts to understand the basis of Blanchot’s argumentation, especially with reference to the “politico-religious” and “writing”. The importance of the notions of the “impossibility of death” and “passivity” which he developed in relation to Levinas’s work has been focused on. In spite of his early orientation in the Christian religion, we see that Blanchot, in his later writings which emphasize an ‘extreme’ literary mode, seems to have striven towards the dissolving of the opposition between East and West, between theism and atheism, and between religion and literature. It is possible that he was thus heralding a post-Christian, post-theological, post-theistic and a postmodern world. 1. This article is dedicated to the memory of Paul Fletcher. Notes 1.

Commenting on the first two essays, Jean-Luc Nancy says that ‘they are truly remarkable in that they show Blanchot rigidly clinging on (“crispation”) to a Christian model of religion and a rejection of everything that seemed inauthentic or confused and diffused; for Blanchot, the Christian source of a very “sublime” representation of God, of the “Very High” with its great mysteries (Trinity, Incarnation, Redemption, Resurrection) and the idea of “communion”, has always played an impor- tant and hidden role’ (personal communication; translated from French by the author). 6. The words in inverted commas are taken from the titles of works on Blanchot: Gerald L. Bruns’ (Citation1997) Maurice Blanchot: The Refusal of Philosophy; Leslie Hill’s (Citation1997) Blanchot: Extreme Contemporary; and Lars Iyer’s (Citation2005) Blanchot’s Vigilance: Literature, Phenomenology and the Ethical. 7. I use the word ‘literature’ broadly to stand for both literature and art. ‘Literature’ appears in the title of Blanchot’s most popular work, The Space of Literature. But more appropriately, one could use Blanchot’s preferred word, ‘writing’, which is meant to denote any politically significant and deconstructive literary or artistic activity. 8. In a short foreword to this work, the author says that he started writing it in 1932, it was delivered to press in May 1940, and was published 1941. 9. The title Faux pas may be interpreted as the acknowledgement of the wrong step that the author had taken towards religion or, more generally, religion as the wrong step. Later, in the 1970s, Blanchot wrote a short work entitled Le pas au-delà, translated into English as The Step Not Beyond (Blanchot Citation1992b). 10. This question is too vast to be discussed here. For a useful account, see Watts (Citation1998) and also Manjali (Citation2008). 11. It is not possible, within the space of this article, to do justice to the variety of issues that have been discussed by philosophers under the rubric of Gandhi’s religious thought. For a useful reference, see Chatterjee (Citation1983). 12. It is useful to consider the specifically Gandhian method of ‘passive resistance’, also known as satyagraha or the ‘adherence to truth’. Gandhi described passive resistance in terms of the ‘soul- force’ (see Gandhi Citation2010, pp. 63–70). It is also tempting to try and compare Gandhi’s ‘passive resis- tance’ with the Levinas–Blanchot notion of ‘passivity’, but that is beyond the scope of this article. 13. In the title of his 1998 biography, Bident aptly calls Blanchot the ‘invisible partner’ (‘partenaire invisible’). Also, Blanchot, a man of the least public presence, was hardly ‘represented’ in the modern visual medium of photographs; not more than three photographs of him are said to have survived for posterity from his long life of 96 years. 14. G. K. Chesterton, journalist and detective fiction writer, was a favourite of many a writer of his time. Gandhi admired his writing. In an article entitled ‘White’s Views on Indian Awakening’ that appeared in his edited journal Indian Opinion (1910), he writes about Chesterton: ‘Mr. G. K. Chesterton is one of the great writers here. He is an Englishman of a liberal temper. Such is the perfection of his style that his writings are read by millions with great avidity … I too believe what he has said is reasonable’. After having quoted profusely from a Chesterton article that appeared in Illustrated London News of 18 September 1909, where the author expresses his strong support for an Indian version of the nation’s freedom, Gandhi concludes: ‘Indians must reflect over these views of Mr. Chesterton and consider what they must demand. What is the way to make Indian people happy? May it not be that we advance our own interests in the name of the Indian people? Or, that we have been endeavouring to destroy what the Indian people have carefully nurtured over thousands of years? I, for one, was led by Mr. Chesterton’s article to all these reflections and I place them before the readers of Indian Opinion’ (Gandhi Citation1910, translated from Gujarati; the present author has referred to the full text of Gandhi as quoted in Parel Citation1993, online version available at http://www.gandhiserve.org/cwmg/VOL010.PDF). In an afterword to Chesterton’s ‘allegorical’ detective fiction, The Man Who Was Thursday, Robert Giddings says: ‘Although he is now a rather neglected literary figure, G. K. Chesterton was one of the most prolific and influential writers and thinkers of the twentieth century. He was a literary and social critic, historian, playwright, novelist, poet, Catholic theologian and apologist and a tireless debater. His literary output included several hundred poems, five novels, some two hundred short stories, four thousand essays and several plays, but he still considered himself primarily a journalist. His … The Man Who Was Thursday – written in 1908 when he was in his mid-thirties – is arguably his best-known novel and, some say, his masterpiece’ (Chesterton Citation2008, p. 175). 15. For an illuminating account of an attempted spiritual convergence, see Aravamudan (Citation2007), particularly Chapter 3, ‘Theosophistries’. As per the author’s succinct account: ‘The Theosophical Society was founded … in New York, in 1875, by Helena P. Blavatsky and Henry S. Olcott. Flirting with Dayananda’s Arya Samaj and integrating itself into the Buddhist and Hindu aspects of spiritual tradition, Theosophy was a cosmopolitan alternative when compared with the parochial nature of the Raj. Founded in the transidiomatic environment generated by the British Empire, Theosophy explored the fungibility of occult practices drawn from plural religious and spiritual traditions’ (Aravamudan Citation2007, p. 105). 16. It is to be noted that Gandhi is more directly denouncing the rise of ‘modern civilisation’. He writes in the preface to Hind Swaraj: ‘The British Government in India constitutes a struggle between the Modern Civilisation, which is the Kingdom of Satan, and the Ancient Civilisation, which is Kingdom of God. The one is the God of War, the other is the God of Love’ (Gandhi Citation2010, p. 8). Gandhi appreciated the deeper values, not only of Christianity, but also of all other major religions. Mahadev Desai, his long-term personal assistant, writes that Gandhi read out passages from the Koran and the Bible, and interpreted them for the benefit of college students at his Sabarmati ashram, near Ahmedabad. When he was charged of being a ‘Christian in secret’, he is reported to have replied: ‘The charge … is both a libel and a complement — a libel because there are men who can believe me to be capable of being secretly anything, i.e., for fear of being that openly. There’s nothing in the world that would keep me from professing Christianity or any other faith, the moment I felt the truth of and the need for it. Where there is fear there is no religion. The charge is a complement in that it is a reluctant acknowledgement of my capacity for appreciating the beauties of Christianity … If I could call myself, say, a Christian, or a Mussalman, with my own interpretation of the Bible or the Quran, I should not hesitate to call myself either. For then, Hindu, Christian, or Mussalman would be synonymous terms’ (Desai Citation1973, pp. 377–378). 17. See the chapter entitled ‘Playing the English Gentleman’ in Gandhi’s autobiography (Gandhi 1927–1929, pp. 41–44). 18. Commenting on Blanchot’s ‘On Hindu Thought’, Jean-Luc Nancy says: ‘This text is milder, less aggressive than the other two. It suggests that Blanchot had to change his tone a little bit. His criticism is turned almost entirely against the chattering of the Westerners. In their loose talk (but Gandhi is not excluded, but in any case we are no longer talking of him) they drown the real issue, which is one of silence or, more precisely listening to the silence. There are a few biblical sources for this. Blanchot must have a silent, sublime “spirit” that retreats to an absolute distance … I admit that these texts leave me with an unpleasant impression of arrogance, not to the East or India, but to a “chatter” certainly rightly criticized (this epoch was very much taken to “Hindu spirituality”…) but also distrusted from a disdainful arrogance that does not explain what it really wants’ (personal communication; translated from French by the author). 19. The original French title of this work is Le Retrait du politique, where the word retrait is intended to mean a ‘retracing’ and a ‘re-treating’ of, as well as a ‘retreat’ from, the ‘political’. 20. Broadly speaking, the notion of ‘passivity’ which recurs in Blanchot and in Levinas may be char- acterised as the incessant surging/appearing in time of the potential within the actual. As absence that interrupts the presence, in a deconstructive movement, it is considered essentially transformative, of both the subjective and the objective as well as of the intersubjective. For instance, for Blanchot, literature as incessant murmur, with its provenance in silence, interrupts the given discourse of the world. 21. Heidegger’s notion of ‘unconcealment’ (aletheia) is also developed in this essay. 22. Nancy is referring to an essay entitled ‘Atheism and Writing: Humanism and the Cry’, a chapter in The Infinite Conversation (Blanchot Citation1992a, pp. 246–263). The original French work is L’entretien infini (Blanchot Citation1969). 23. Levinas has often spoken of ‘God’ in terms of the ‘wholly other’ or the ‘absolutely other’. However, Gérard Bensussan, an important French scholar on Levinas, points out that the notion of God as the ‘wholly other’ is not central to Levinas’s thought of God (personal communication).",Aesthetics | Art | Epistemology | History | Law | Literature | Philosophy | Political science | Politics | Sociology | Visual arts,https://openalex.org/W2317151680,0.0,,OpenAlex,14

Lycette Nelson (Albany, SUNY Press, 1992), p.19. 2 See John M. Meyer, Political Nature: Environmentalism and the Interpretation of Western Thought (Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press, 2001) on the recurrent fallacy that politics is derivative from nature (p.15). Greens are now frequently criticized for using references to 'ecology' to serve the age-old fallacy of using appeals to nature to mask what are essentially contentious political judgments. The now discredited notion that the 'ecological' itself necessarily represents a principle of balance, harmony, diversity and interconnection, etc. has been especially hard to dispel. Even the relatively sophisticated green anarchism of Murray Bookchin bases itself on the 'ecological' in that sense, with its idealization of a wild, unaltered ecosystem as inherently 'libertarian', that is 'an image of unity in diversity, spontaneity and complementary relationships, free of all hierarchy and domination' (The Ecology of Freedom: The Emergence and Dissolution of Hierarchy 1982 (Edinburgh: AK Press, 2005), p.453). An 'organic' human society for Bookchin would thus be one in supposed harmony with nature as a space of 'symbiosis and mutualism', p.460. This essay is not, it should be needless to say, an attack on environmental thinking per se, but it tries to contribute to the necessary task of ridding it of elements of intellectual anachronism. 3 See his Ecology without Nature (Cambridge Mass.: Harvard UP, 2008). 4 Maurice Blanchot, The Infinite Conversation, trans.

Where are the songs of spring? Ay, where are they? Think not of them, thou hast thy music too,- While barred clouds bloom the soft-dying day, And touch the stubble-plains with rosy hue; Then in a wailful choir the small gnats mourn Among the river sallows, borne aloft Or sinking as the light wind lives or dies; And full-grown lambs loud bleat from hilly bourn; Hedge-crickets sing; and now with treble soft The red-breast whistles from a garden-croft; And gathering swallows twitter in the skies.

By changing his writing, and by reiterating the dialogical form so central to metaphysical tradition since Plato, Blanchot gives voice to the tensions between continuity and its ‘outside’, between philosophy and literature.

Poetic Hauntology in Derrida, Blanchot and Morrison’s Beloved",Elisabeth Marie Loevlie,,2013,2013-07-04,Religions,,article,en,False,"Literature, this paper argues, is a privileged language that can give form to those specters of existence that resist the traditional ontological boundaries of being and non-being, alive and dead. This I describe as the “hauntology” of literature. Literature, unlike our everyday, referential language, is not obliged to refer to a determinable reality, or to sustain meaning. It can therefore be viewed as a negation of the world of things and sensible phenomena. Yet it gives us access to vivid and sensory rich worlds. The status of this literary world, then, is strangely in-between; its ontology is not present and fixed, but rather quivering or ghostlike. The “I” that speaks in a literary text never coincides with the “I” of the writing subject, rather they haunt each other. This theoretical understanding is based on texts by Jacques Derrida and Maurice Blanchot. The paper also draws an analogy between this spectral dynamic of literature and an understanding of religious faith or belief. Belief relates to that which cannot be ontologically fixed or verified, be it God, angels, or spirits. Literature, because it releases and sustains this ontological quivering, can transmit the ineffable, the repressed and transcendent. With this starting point, I turn to Toni Morrison’s book Beloved (1987) and to Beloved’s strange, spectral monologue. By giving literary voice to the dead, Morrison releases literature’s hauntology to express the horror that history books cannot convey, and that our memory struggles to contain.",Analogy | Art | Computer science | Epistemology | Faith | History of literature | Library science | Linguistics | Literature | Meaning (existential) | Negation | Ontology | Philosophy | Poetry | Subject (documents),https://openalex.org/W2165192391,42.0,,OpenAlex,14

This possibility [vertu] is laid bare in the poetic said. [. . .] It is shown in the prophetic said. —Emmanuel Lévinas, Otherwise than Being [my emphasis] Writing, without placing itself above art, supposes that one not prefer art, but efface art as writing effaces itself. —Maurice Blanchot, Writing of the Disaster In an effort to elucidate a more originary difference than Heidegger's ontological difference between Being and entities, as well as an ethicity of thinking able to respond to the trace of transcendence of the other's face, Lévinas's philosophy redefines language radically and does so in uneasy proximity to poetic language. In Otherwise than Being or Beyond Essence (1974), Lévinas deploys a constellation of terms—discourse, expression, communication, face, sincerity, witnessing, prophecy—in order to elucidate the ethical dimension of language, the ethicity of philosophical discourse. This constellation revolves around the crucial notion of signification and the two operative concepts of the said (le dit) and saying (le dire). By the former Lévinas understands the semantic content of an utterance or the giving of signs by a sender to an addressee, but also the different modalities by which a subject masters the world by assimilating it to the measure of consciousness (discourse, narration, history, manifestation, representation). Saying (le dire) refers to the way of signifying primarily that I am for the other, the expression of being-for-the-other that subjectivity ""is"" before positioned as the source of signs or comprehension: subjectivity as exposition. While the said expresses a content, the saying is expression without content. Language for Lévinas is the ""structure"" of both the retraction and the inscription of infinity (l'infini), and this ""structure"" is what Lévinas calls ethics. It is thus possible to affirm that in Lévinas there is no ethical turn without a certain linguistic turn, one in which the a priori of language is interrupted by an anteriority whose a priori character is enigmatic. But Lévinas's linguistic turn is turned inside out: for him language contains the other's call and thus harbors a form of exteriority within itself. This is because language is elevated to a metaphysical category (in the sense of Totality and Infinity [1961], where it means the breaching or interruption of totality) that exceeds the simple [End Page 14] ""giving out of signs"" [délivrance de signes] [AE 81/OB 48] or communication. Lévinas claims that ""saying is communication, to be sure, but as a condition for all communication, as exposure [exposition]"" [AE 82/OB 48]. Signification precedes and defines language as proximity and contact with the other and not as the ""vicissitude [peripetia] of the thematizing intentionality"" [AE 216/OB 137] of a subject whose main attribute is its ability to synchronize questions and answers, being and its manifestations, and by so doing leaves no margin for being exposed to the other. Further, signification also names an enigmatic pre-diction that challenges the primacy that language, understood as a system of signs, enjoys in other philosophies (structuralism and analytic philosophy, for example). Most critics agree that Lévinas's philosophy is inhospitable to aesthetic phenomena and ambivalent toward poetic language. His severe condemnation of the work of art in ""Reality and Its Shadow"" (1948) is still present in Totality and Infinity, Lévinas's first major work, where he establishes a relation with the other as face-to-face in discourse. And although in Otherwise than Being Lévinas finally acknowledges ""poetic"" language's ability to suggest significations that exceed the order of discourse and even endows it with a (quasi)-ethical force...",Allusion | Art | Computer science | Economics | Epistemology | Expression (computer science) | Face (sociological concept) | Finance | Linguistics | Literature | Meaning (existential) | Order (exchange) | Philosophy | Poetics | Poetry | Programming language | Psychology | Sincerity | Social psychology | TRACE (psycholinguistics) | Utterance,https://openalex.org/W2017379480,2.0,,OpenAlex,14

This will imply reviewing the nomination as conceptualizing operation, and will lead to reflect on the status of death that occurs in language (of what exists, but also of the author) and to ask about the materiality of words. As it hopes to show, one can see in these analyzes about language a contamination between logic and poetry, and this allows reconfiguring the relationship between the human and the rest of the living beings. Finally, the work interrogate what future thought and philosophy may have after such analyzes, and proposes a possible path",Philosophy | Humanities | Poetry | Linguistics,https://openalex.org/W2991104666,0.0,,OpenAlex,14
10.5325/complitstudies.51.3.e-9,Blanchot and Literary Criticism,John McKeane,,2014,2014-09-01,Comparative Literature Studies,The Pennsylvania State University Press,article,en,False,"If this study is to be noted and remembered, it will perhaps because of the constraints it places on commonplace references to Blanchot's literary criticism. To write not on “X's Literary Criticism” but on “X and Literary Criticism” is to suggest a distance, a relationship that must be decided on rather than assumed. Accordingly, here, Blanchot's writing is considered in relation not only to literary criticism, but also to literary theory, philosophy, and the subtle differences between these and other modes of thought.In his exposition, Hewson lets fall many of the texts that might have been considered, from Faux Pas (1943) to Lautréamont and Sade (1949, 2nd ed. 1963) and The Book to Come (1959). Instead, he concentrates largely on The Work of Fire (1949) and The Space of Literature (1955). The discussion raises the possibility of Blanchot defending “a ‘metaphysics’ of poetry” (105), a quasi-theology or absolutism rising above historical contingency. On one level, this gives rise to the claim that The Space of Literature demonstrates a “hermetic ‘method’” (94); it also chimes with various attacks made on Blanchot from this angle (by Jean Laplanche for being an “idealist,” by Derrida for “essentialism”). This possibility of absolutism stems from the fact that Blanchot does not privilege any stable literary corpus, but instead investigates an always anterior Poem or Work, together with various writers' attempts to respond to the demands it places on them. These issues are discussed in chapter 3, “Mallarmé and Modern Poetics.” Beyond this, chapter 5 is particularly helpful in unpacking this thinking of the Work, which recasts Heidegger's thesis that only thought can allow being to find its true dwelling place. For Blanchot, this thought consists of both writing (what never begins) and reading (what never stops): any absolute status accorded to the Work thus takes on the characteristic of powerlessness, being severed from progressive historical time. The later collection of essays and texts, The Infinite Conversation (1969), is also mentioned on occasion. It seems to be crucial to Hewson's larger argument that it belongs to a different era in Blanchot's writing, one in which philosophy comes more directly to the fore. This might therefore lead us to identify The Work of Fire and The Space of Literature as less philosophical works. However, a valuable aspect of Hewson's reading is his underlining of how these earlier works draw on philosophy as a subterranean influence or—in the literal sense—a motif. This philosophy can be seen at work in the fact that Blanchot's writing on literature swiftly leaves the descriptive mode behind. It focuses instead on the movement or “event” (106) whereby writing comes into being, this movement taking the form of “the privation of world, self and time whose description occupies so much of Blanchot's work” (89). In other words, the philosophy that informs and inflects his relation to literary criticism would be one that moves away from underlying essences and toward the différance of shifting inscription.Beyond metaphysical absolutism and Heideggerian philosophy, a third yardstick for Blanchot's enterprise is what Hewson names literary theory. In general terms, this term surely belongs at the less helpful end of a spectrum of terms that are unhelpful in varying degree (to a lesser degree, see also “post-structuralism” and “deconstruction”). Unfortunately, Hewson's use of it does little to change this situation. Literary theory is variously defined as “representational inquiry” (116), as a discourse “oriented towards a methodological definition of the object that is to be studied” (102), and as defining “the literary by its linguistic properties or its cultural or institutional status” (140). That Blanchot does not engage in such enterprises seems convincing enough; bundling them together does little more than create a straw man.A further notion that arises regarding discursive categorization sits uneasily with the others. It lies both outside the study's purview, and creeps within it thanks to the several telling references. This notion is that of narrative. At first sight, Hewson has decided to let fall this other half of Blanchot's writing. This is perhaps regrettable, given that few have yet had the nerve to write on his novels and récits at any length (it is more serious that the unsuspecting reader is given no indication whatsoever of the existence of these works, in the bibliography or elsewhere). Upon closer inspection, however, numerous elements of The Space of Literature, such as its discussion of Orpheus, are referred to as “mythic ‘narratives’” (121) and “the construction of a mythic and narrative space of writing” (121–22). Given the work's declaration that its kernel is to be found in Orpheus (its hero or antihero?), he who like the critic is defined by his gaze on the other, this return of narrative, its influx into Blanchot's supposedly nonnarrative work, might have been further explored.Let us remain with Hewson's perhaps unBlanchotian but nonetheless helpful descriptions of the idiosyncratic form of the essays and collections at hand. They are said to be “closer in form to the meditation than to the demonstration” (xiv) and we read that “the thought tends to develop through repetition and restatement, rather than by a linear sequential progression, and constantly returns to the same basic insights from different angles” (67). These are ways in which the “absolutist” or “idealist” hypothesis can be attenuated or refined: this absolute is one that exists in and through the all-too-relative churn of language and argumentation. Such is perhaps what is meant by the suggestion that “this study has emphasized the historical dimension of Blanchot's criticism” (136). Hewson explains that such historicity does not imply that this criticism is compatible with the tendencies of its time (whether Marxist or formalist). Rather, it would be philosophically historical, that is, given shape by the essenceless movement of the modern age (explored in chapter 1, “The Modern Age and the ‘Work; of Literature”).We also read that “the critical text is a repetition of the poetic text” (xv), suggesting that writer and critic are merely two points on one sliding scale. Both look toward something that does not belong to any work, not even that of the poet, with the critic merely looking at it over the poet's shoulder (in the case of Hölderlin and Blanchot, that something can be called the opening of the poetic—see chapter 2). In a wider sense, to pass through the work of others signals the exhaustion of literary creativity, as if the only path to newness lay in repeating what has already been said. To be sure, writing on others' works remains a mode of writing—but it is a residual one, allowing a certain space to be defended against the individual's untiring claims to originality. Hewson signals that Blanchot's already idiosyncratic relationship with literary criticism continued to shift after The Space of Literature: indeed, a voice will soon tell us that “I am astonished that every work of criticism, even the most traditional, does not begin with a lengthy apology” (The Infinite Conversation, 326).",Art | Computer science | Criticism | Database | Elegy | Epistemology | Literary criticism | Literary science | Literary theory | Literature | Metaphysics | Philosophy | Poetics | Poetry | Relation (database),https://openalex.org/W4231220173,0.0,,"Crossref, OpenAlex",13

In a forthcoming essay, “Art's Inhumanity,” I explore how “Reality and Its Shadow” juxtaposes a critique of Heidegger's ontological use of the work of art to a more general critique of the materiality of the work of art. Levinas's argument revolves around a debatable interpretation of the biblical prohibition of representation. It is necessary to stress that in Otherwise than Being the reversal of ontological difference is followed by its re‐inscription and displacement. This is a precondition for writing the “otherwise than being,” as Levinas states explicitly in the Preface to the second edition of De l'existence à l'existant (1977) and in part as a response to Jean‐Luc Marion's objections in L'Idole et la distance. Levinas's treatment of Heidegger's ontological difference is a contentious issue, as evidenced in Derrida's “Violence and Metaphysics.” For an assessment of this problematic, see Silvano Petrossino, “D'un livre à l'autre.

Simon Critchley has systematically studied the different conceptions of the il y a in Levinas and Blanchot in his Very Little … Almost Nothing! Death, Philosophy and Finitude. For a reading more attuned to the dimension of a saying that exceeds the grasp of the said, see Jacques Derrida, “La Loi du genre” in Parages Derrida Jacques Parages Paris: Galilée 1986 [Google Scholar].

See Maurice Blanchot, “Knowledge of the Unknown” in The Infinite Conversation Blanchot Maurice The Infinite Conversation Trans. Susan Hanson. Minneapolis: U of Minnesota P 1993 [Google Scholar]. The thinking/writing of the neuter can take place only by presupposing that the working of totality has already been accomplished (Hegel) and that the neuter does not constitute a form of opening (Heidegger). In the first part of The Infinite Conversation the neuter becomes the question of the “other than being” or “the most profound question” (EI 1–39/IC 5–47). This turning point opens a new period in Blanchot in which writing, understood as the question of the neuter, is also conceived as the question of the other in the ethical sense of the term. This period closes with The Step (Not) Beyond (1973) and The Writing of the Disaster (1980). See Emmanuel Levinas, “Interiority and Economy” in Totality and Infinity 109–21. “Is Ontology Fundamental?”; “Freedom and Command” (1953); “The Ego and the Totality” (1954); and “Philosophy and the Idea of Infinity” (1957). This distinction was never overlooked by Blanchot, as the following formulation makes clear: “Writing, without placing itself above art, supposes that one not prefer art, but efface art as writing effaces itself” (ED 89/WD 53). Taking into account the different ways that Heidegger and Levinas understand this term. While for the former ethics refers to an ontic or regional domain grounded in metaphysics (Letter on Humanism), for the latter ethics refers to a breaching of ontology. Much like Heidegger, Blanchot is apprehensive regarding the term “ethics,” but does not elude the force of the ethical injunction, as The Writing of the Disaster and The Step (Not) Beyond clearly show. See Maurice Blanchot, The Space of Literature Blanchot Maurice The Space of Literature Trans. Ann Smock. Lincoln: U of Nebraska P 1992 [Google Scholar] and his Au moment voulu Blanchot Maurice Au moment voulu Paris: Gallimard 1951 [Google Scholar]. See Jacques Derrida, “Violence and Metaphysics” in Writing and Difference Derrida Jacques Writing and Difference Trans. Alan Bass. Chicago: U of Chicago P 1978 [Google Scholar]. “Le Servant et son maître” originally appeared in Critique 229 (1966). These concepts are the trace, the distinction between the said and saying, as well as the ethical reduction of the said to the saying. The French text reads: “fait signe sans que le signe soit porteur de une signification en se déssaisant de la signification” (SMB 39). Blanchot has insistently questioned the modern doxa on writing's self‐referentiality. That writing becomes a question as “the question of writing” (objective and subjective genitives) means that the borders separating inside and outside open themselves up in a complex manner. The inner core of language (the other, the referent) becomes the strange par excellence. A good way of characterizing Blanchot's project would be by employing a Lacanian expression: “the extimate [extimité] writing.” Lacan used the term extimité in his seminars. Jacques‐Alain Miller gave currency to this term in his unpublished Seminar 1, 2, 3. Maurice Blanchot, La Folie du jour Blanchot Maurice La Folie du jour Paris: Fata Morgana 1973 [Google Scholar].

Nouveau Commerce, 30–31: 19–44. [Google Scholar] 19–44. These fragments later became part of The Writing of the Disaster. “The work […] is a movement from the Same toward the Other that never returns to the Same. To the myth of Ulysses returning to Ithaca, we would like to oppose Abraham's story leaving his homeland for good for a land yet unknown” (EEHH 191; translation mine). For Blanchot's reading of Odysseus as a conceptual persona of the man of power, see “Le Chant des sirènes” in Le Livre à venir (Paris: Gallimard, 1959). Odysseus' figure has to be opposed to Orpheus', the poet whose infidelity is both toward the realm of action and power, as well as to that of the artwork. The reader should note that the expression “sens inspiré” is deleted from the English translation, although it appears in the second paragraph within a less decisive context. Outdoors, I had a brief vision: a few steps away from me, just at the corner of the street I was about to leave, a woman with a baby carriage had stopped, I could not see her very well, she was maneuvering the carriage to get it through the outer door. At that moment a man whom I had not seen approaching went in through that door. He had already stepped across the sill when he moved backward and came out again. While he stood next to the door, the baby carriage, passing in front of him, lifted slightly to cross the sill, and the young woman, after raising her head to look at him, also disappeared inside.

Rather than using ethnography to determine the ways in which, cultural differences aside, we all share a common humanity, this body of work uses ethnography to figure out how humanity and sociality are produced in radically divergent ways, giving rise to different forms of “the social” and different forms of cosmology. We have thus left behind the realm of many (cultural) perspectives on one common (natural) world, and entered a realm of different ontologies. This brings the ethnographer face to face with the question of the outside. But which meaning(s) might be given to the outside? Is it located on the far side of language or cognition? Of intersubjectivity? Or does it designate what is external to sociality and humanity as such? In the interest of finding resources for grappling with these questions, this inquiry explores the works of quasi-ethnographer Carlos Castaneda and literary theorist and novelist Maurice Blanchot. Doing so, it elicits and articulates two radically distinct forms of the outside.

,"The work of friendship : Blanchot, Bataille, Hegel",Richard Stamp,,1999,1999-09-01,,,dissertation,en,,"In this thesis I argue that friendship holds a unique and unusual place in the work
of Maurice Blanchot (1907-). It traces the appearance of this relation in his essays
during the period from 1946 to 1962. Key to his work at this time, j argue, is the
work of his friend Georges Bataille (1897-1960), whom he met in 1940. The
influence of each writer upon the work of the other, I argue, is inseparable from
the thought of friendship which both pursue, albeit in different and apparently
conflicting ways: Bataille figures the relation to the friend as complicity, a term
which he presents in terms of a quasi-ontological determination 'the labyrinthine
constitution of beings'; and Blanchot locates friendship in terms of a movement of
discretion or discontinuity which interrupts being in order for there to be relation
as such. It is shown how both thinkers reinscribe friendship into their work in
general through these figures, which allow them to articulate questions of
memory, death and the 'work'. It is in this sense that friendship, for both writers,
is 'at work' within their work. Central to this determination of 'the work' is
G. W. F. Hegel's Phenomenology of Spirit, which had been introduced into French
intellectual life principally by two commentators, Alexandre Kojeve and Jean
Hyppolite. The figural differences between complicity and discretion are traced to
their respective readings of Hegel. Bataille's debt to Kojeve's interpretation forms
the starting point of this linkage between the question of friendship and the status
of the work. The pivotal role which Kojeve ascribes to the relation of mastery and
slavery - the emergence of self-consciousness as the work of recognition
[Anerkennung] - is used to draw out Hegel's genetic account of intersubjectivity
(in recognition, love, and friendship). I show that Bataille's conception of
sovereignty not only seeks to oppose this dialectic of mastery ... Hegelianly ... ; it
also situates itself within this dialectic at the very moment which Kojeve defines
in terms of the limited aniniality of friendship and love. As a result, Bataille's
thought of friendship extends to characterise the impossibility into which this
dialectic is inevitably collapsed. Yet the question remains as to how far his
reliance upon Kojeve puts this strategy of collapse under an ever-present threat of
having to repeat those 'Hegelian' strategies which he claims to have 'undone'.
The final chapter in the thesis, therefore, sets out a characterisation. of Blanchot's
reading of Hegel. Against the grain of most Blanchot commentaries, I show that
Blanchot's reading cannot be derived solely from Kojeve. By linking the pivotal
function of terms such as 'disquiet' ['Unruhe'] and key passages from Hegel's
texts, it is argued that he draws extensively upon the commentaries and
translations of Hyppolite: this approach allows him to amplify the importance of
language in the Phenomenology of Spirit; and to identify in this text key questions
of ambiguity - such as the relation of language and negativity; the place of
memory in the work of art; and the fate of art in the modem world. It is Hegel's
ambiguous linkage of friendship with the latter which leads to his own effacement
of Bataille's relation between friendship and art, and to the definition of a 'work
of friendship' in the self-effacement of discretion.",Friendship | Hegelianism | Relation (database) | Philosophy | Complicity | Epistemology | Psychoanalysis | Literature | Law | Social psychology | Psychology | Art | Political science | Database | Computer science,https://openalex.org/W1830564584,0.0,,OpenAlex,12

10.1353/mlr.2022.0056,Two Narrative Thrusts: Reading Malone Dies with Bergson and Blanchot,Li Lianghui,,2022,2022-04-01,The Modern Language Review,,article,en,False,"Two Narrative Thrusts:Reading Malone Dies with Bergson and Blanchot Lianghui Li A key feature in Samuel Beckett's prose works is a gesture of negation from the middle period of his creative career. Brian Richardson names it 'denarration', and conceptualizes it as a narrative strategy characterized by an erasure of textual construction.1 In the rising genetic criticism of Beckett in recent years, the form of epanorthosis, meaning 'the rhetorical use of self-correction and word replacement', is extensively explored.2 The gesture of negation interrogates the coherence and rationality of the entire narrative and renders the text 'radically unquotable', as logical anomalies and confusion are conjured.3 Indeed, Beckett, in his German letter to Axel Kaun, advances the concept of 'literature of the unword' ('Literatur des Unworts'), which, as Dirk Van Hulle and Shane Weller put it, 'turns language against itself, in the hope that [. . .] that which lies beyond it may finally be glimpsed'.4 Moreover, the gesture of negation has a bearing on questions concerning the narrator and the entire project as searching for an end. In Malone Dies (1951), many narrative anomalies seem to eliminate the possibility of a narrator, such as the arbitrary naming of the self as Malone, the suspicious act of writing, and the pervasive negation of narration. With the assumption of a narrator undermined, a reading of the novel needs to anatomize the narrating force in order to make sense of narrative contradiction. Arguably, Malone Dies revolves around a central issue of the ending, in that a narrator insists from the beginning that its upcoming death will coincide with the end of its stories. Although the project's feasibility is subject to question, and although the doubt towards it is self-consciously featured throughout the novel, the ultimate goal to make an end does not change. Two features stand out within the ending project. Firstly, there is an emphasis placed on the process leading to the end. Owing to the unpredictability of death, the measuring process obtains as much significance as the end itself. The novel registers a radical exploration of time in procession. This concentration upon the process, as an indivisible state of consciousness in contrast with a perceptible object, is similarly formulated in Henri Bergson's [End Page 221] conceptualization of duration. Secondly, the desire to die a controllable death recalls Maurice Blanchot in terms of both the difference between suicide and the 'ungraspable' death, and the comparable domains of death and writing.5 Taking its cue from Bergson and Blanchot, this article suggests that the novel features two narrative thrusts, namely, the durational narration and a splitting attempt to secure a subjectivity in order to die. Durational narration asserts its temporal significance and its complete inaccessibility, whereas subjective perception derives from the narrative self-reflexivity. If duration as internal time suggests a being predicated solely on the continuous act of narration, it cannot be appropriated by any attempt at consciousness created from within the course of the narration. The bifurcated narration thus problematizes the first-person pronoun in Malone Dies. The 'I' cannot refer to the legitimate narrator in the novel. Likewise, Malone is not the valid name of the 'I'. It is a pseudo-narrator that seeks to claim the durational process of narration in order to consolidate a subjectivity. The proposal of two narrative thrusts also clarifies the paradox of the ending. The impossible task of matching death to the end of storytelling indicates the pseudo-narrator's failure to accommodate the contradictory objectives of self-creation and self-immolation in the process of narration. Introducing time into the study of Malone Dies adds another layer to the complicated relationship between the narrator and the narrated. This layer is exterior to the narrative and concerns the generation of words in its unidirectional progression. In this way, the unstoppable words present duration in a pure sense, whereas the narrative fragmentally represents a pseudo-narration. In turn, the paradoxical split permeating Beckett's works could be reconsidered as the conflict between the limit of a pseudo-narrator and the holistic words that mark duration.

,Maurice Blanchot et son écriture,Ken Sumiyoshi,,2019,2019-10-18,,,dissertation,fr,,"C’est l’inspiration qui nous incite essentiellement a la parole. Mais l’homme, avant l’acte d’ecrire/parler et au moment de l’acte ou apres l’acte, est-il identique ? Si le sujet de l’acte pourrait y repondre positivement, nous le contestons. A quel moment arrive donc a l’homme une fissure d’identite ? Nous montrons qu’elle lui arrive au moment de l’inspiration. A l’aube de la philosophie, Platon suppose l’identite entre ce que l’inspiration demande a l’homme de mettre en mots et les mots qu’il lui confere. Le dualisme platonicien du monde sensible et de celui suprasensible est connu, mais cette structure qui envisage l’idee en tant que but final est, comme le detecte correctement Nietzsche, elle-meme motivee par l’idee. Cette derniere, en tant qu’inspiration, declenche et guide le mouvement platonicien vers elle. Situee au commencement aussi bien qu’a la fin, elle est identique, et Hegel et Heidegger sont dans la meme lignee. C’est contre et dans cette identite qui constitue un cercle, que nous introduisons une difference ou une alterite, et cela notamment par l’idee d’immediat. L’inspiration, lorsqu’elle nous arrive, n’y reste pas ; aussitot apparue, elle disparait immediatement et en meme temps. Elle ne reste pas pour nous guider vers elle mais ne fait que passer, ce qui revient a signifier qu’elle ne nous montre pas sa presence directrice, mais son absence. D’ou que, si l’homme croit donner ses mots a ce que l’inspiration lui murmure sans langage, il les donne en realite a la trace de l’inspiration ou a l’absence de l’inspiration. Par les mots, il n’incarne pas l’inspiration mais il en forme une image, et l’une des plus grandes problematiques est que Platon, Hegel et Heidegger prennent l’image comme inspiration, ils prennent l’absence de quelque chose comme sa presence, sans difference ni alterite. Cette homogeneisation de l’une et de l’autre qui sont en realite differentes l’une de l’autre, ainsi que l’identite a laquelle elle aboutit, sont dues a la puissance magique de l’image dont il n’est pas facile de se rendre compte.Mais, par l’idee de difference et d’alterite, ne pourrait-on pas dire que commence alors quelque chose d’autre que l’inspiration, c’est-a-dire quelque chose de nouveau ? C’est le cas de la pensee de Levinas. Et pourtant, le juif, dont nous decouvrons que la pensee consiste a etendre la specificite de l’inspiration d’un instant a tous les instants, prepare une radicalisation blanchotienne de l’absence. C’est par le langage que se realise cette radicalisation. Le langage n’est pas une serie de mots munis de sens coherents, mais il est avant tout une serie de phonemes et de lettres. D’ailleurs, cette serie n’est pas une continuite : lorsque chaque phoneme, par son immediatete, disparait en meme temps qu’il apparait, il est totalement indifferent de ce qui le precede et de ce qui le suit. Il rompt tout rapport avec les autres au niveau spatio-temporel, ce qui fait de la serie de phonemes une continuite du discontinu. Ainsi, ce que l’homme obtient par le langage, est-ce non une totalite langagiere constituant une signification, mais un ensemble d’inspirations disparues a chaque moment, a savoir un ensemble d’images qui n’ont aucun rapport les unes avec les autres. Notre recherche nous menera alors a repondre a la question de savoir si l’homme, avant l’acte d’ecrire/parler et au moment de l’acte ou apres l’acte, est identique. Nous y repondons negativement, non que le langage confere une nouvelle identite a un homme, mais qu’il lui echappe a chaque instant, c’est-a-dire qu’il ne s’est jamais agi d’une identite quelconque, sauf d’une identite basee sur une image fallacieusement continuelle.",Humanities | Philosophy | Ethnology | Sociology,https://openalex.org/W2995854394,0.0,,OpenAlex,12

,"Aesthetics of Negativity: Blanchot, Adorno, and Autonomy",William Allen,,2016,2016-04-01,,,book,en,,"Maurice Blanchot and Theodor W. Adorno are among the most difficult but also the most profound thinkers in twentieth-century aesthetics. While their methods and perspectives differ widely, they share a concern with the negativity of the artwork conceived in terms of either its experience and possibility or its critical expression. Such negativity is neither nihilistic nor pessimistic but concerns the status of the artwork and its autonomy in relation to its context or its experience. For both Blanchot and Adorno negativity is the key to understanding the status of the artwork in post-Kantian aesthetics and, although it indicates how art expresses critical possibilities, albeit negatively, it also shows that art bears an irreducible ambiguity such that its meaning can always negate itself. This ambiguity takes on an added material significance when considered in relation to language as the negativity of the work becomes aesthetic in the further sense of being both sensible and experimental, and in doing so the language of the literary work becomes a form of thinking that enables materiality to be thought in its ambiguity. In a series of rich and compelling readings, William S. Allen shows how an original and rigorous mode of thinking arises within Blanchot’s early writings and how Adorno’s aesthetics depends on a relation between language and materiality that has been widely overlooked. Furthermore, by reconsidering the problem of the autonomous work of art in terms of literature, a central issue in modernist aesthetics is given a greater critical and material relevance as a mode of thinking that is abstract and concrete, rigorous and ambiguous. While examples of this kind of writing can be found in the works of Blanchot and Beckett, the demands that such texts place on readers only confirm the challenges and the possibilities that literary autonomy poses to thought.",Materiality (auditing) | Aesthetics | Ambiguity | Autonomy | Relation (database) | Negativity effect | Philosophy | Context (archaeology) | Pessimism | Meaning (existential) | Work of art | Epistemology | Art | Psychology | Linguistics | History | Social psychology | Archaeology | Database | Political science | Computer science | Law,https://openalex.org/W2620054396,11.0,,OpenAlex,12

Perteneciente a la generación de 27 y Mediodía, nacido hace 120 años, es Romero Murube el poeta que más páginas dedica a la ciudad andaluza en la primera mitad del siglo XX. Precisamente, toda su producción ensayística, periodística, pero sobre todo poética, gira en torno a la ciudad y la convierte su «espacio literario» por medio de una obra que es, además, contemplativa y «paseante». La investigación se centra en las obras poéticas de la década de 1940, momento de encuentro y madurez poética del autor, donde se encuentran y aplican las tesis de Blanchot de la «soledad del escritor» y de la «exigencia de la obra». De igual modo, se establece una correspondencia con el mito de Orfeo, que analiza y propone el escritor francés, con la poesía de Romero Murube. Así, en este entorno de la Sevilla de la Exposición Iberoamericana de 1929, se construye y desarrolla su poesía, concepto «paseante» de la misma y «espacio». Por todo ello, las herramientas de análisis que proporciona Blanchot son una forma, sin duda, novedosa y reveladora de profundización y acercamiento a dicha obra y a Sevilla, sobre todo, en sus poemarios que van desde Canción del amante Andaluz (1942) a Tierra y Canción (1948).",Art | Humanities,https://openalex.org/W4411352304,0.0,,OpenAlex,12

Nous sommes tous la pègre: les années 68 de Blanchot. Minuit, 2018. ISBN 978-2-7073-4417-5. Pp. 131. Maurice Blanchot came to prominence during the 1930s as a defender of far-right causes, but over time he moved to the other end of the spectrum. Nous sommes tous la pègre focuses on his activities during May–June 1968 in Paris. During this time period, his increasingly radical ideas about literature and politics found concrete expression in support of the student-inspired social agitation. With friends he founded le comité d'action étudiants-écrivains, which was one of the approximately 460 comités created at that time (110). The numerous divergences among these groups and the difficulties they had in cooperating may explain Hamel's subtitle, les années 68, since few groups experienced the events of that summer in the same way. Blanchot wrote many of the tracts distributed by his comité and was dubbed by Dionys Mascolo the ""ange [...] de la méditation"" (9). The comité d'action étudiants-écrivains lasted until February 1969 when it was disbanded due to internal bickering. Just after World War II Blanchot was much taken by Alexandre Kojève's claim that Hegel proclaimed la fin [End Page 229] de l'histoire (12). Yet, he came to understand the expression not in any positive sense (history had achieved its goals), but as a glorification of the subjugation of humanity, particularly workers. From his perspective, revolutions up to the present have followed a frustrating cycle: a social structure judged oppressive is overthrown by a new order which becomes oppressive, and in turn is overthrown, without the condition of the poor undergoing real change. In mai 68 Blanchot saw the opportunity for a true revolution characterized by an absence of any authoritarian system, a refusal of any intellectual hierarchy—""une grève d'intelligence"" (38), and ""une affirmation de [la] parfaite identité"" of politics and literature (66). At the heart of this new dispensation would be ""le Grand Refus"" (87), a rejection of any constraining social system, and perhaps also of the system itself. In Henri Lefebvre's words, what was desired was ""un refus radical et total de l'existant"" (77). The workers would no longer be proletarians, but ""une pure 'présence interchangeable,'"" now aware of the enormous possibilities open to them, and would morph into la foule since ""c'est la pluralité anonyme de la foule qui fait et défait l'histoire"" (82–83). Reading about May 68 today raises many questions about Blanchot's positions. Certainly, his claim that after May 68, ""PLUS RIEN NE SERA COMME AVANT"" (128), seems sadly naïve, as was his confidence that workers would be de facto catalysts for radical social change. Indeed, despite Blanchot's efforts at mingling with les travailleurs, one wonders whether he had any idea of the frustrations, needs, and aspirations of this social class. Like many intellectuals then and now, Blanchot could be forceful in his dissection of the status quo while remaining at a loss to suggest a viable alternative. In certain circumstances, just saying ""no"" should be enough, but changing the world is another matter.

,"Romantic Poetry and the Fragmentary Imperative: Schlegel, Byron, Joyce, Blanchot",Mark Sandy,,2006,2006-12-01,The Byron Journal,,article,en,,"ROMANTIC POETRY AND THE FRAGMENTARY IMPERATIVE: SCHLEGEL, BYRON, JOYCE, BLANCHOT. By Christopher A. Strathman. Albany, NY: State University of New York Press, 2005. Pp. xi + 204. ISBN 0-7914-6457-1. $60.00. Christopher A. Strathman's Romantic Poetry and the Fragmentary Imperative explores the centrality of Friedrich Schlegel's notions of irony and 'romanticisch poesie' to German Romantic theory and British Romantic practice. Strathman recognises the difficulty of policing these categories as 'such a distinction between theory and practice is problematic as romantic theory is very much informed by early modern European, especially English, practice'. This typifies Strathman's ability to present theoretical complexity with great clarity and insight without recourse to the jargon favoured by some literary theorists. Read through Schlegel's 'call for a new and highly self-conscious literary work that embodies the fractured, decentred consciousness of ancient dialogue', Strathman conceives of Romantic poetry as derived from an anti-Aristotelian philosophical genealogy that 'look[s] back through Plato and Socrates to pre-Socratic writing, the tragic chorus, and Homer, while at the same time looking forward to Nietzsche, Heidegger, and the twentieth-century avant-garde'. Strathman champions intellectual history and formal qualities over the historicity of material fact and circumstance - the approach favoured by Marjorie Levinson's The Romantic Fragment Poem (1986) - and finds a closer affinity with Thomas McFarland's Heideggerian outlook in Romanticism and the Forms of Ruin (1981), Balachandra Rajan's The Form of the Unfinished (1985) and Anne Janowitz's English Ruins (1990). Strathman's reassessment of the genre of Romantic fragment and fragmentary writing in light of these philosophical and formal concerns also provides a timely and welcome addendum to Susan Wolfson's recent work on the poetic forms of British Romanticism in Formal Charges (1997). Strathman shares Maurice Blanchot's sense that those gestures of 'fragmentary writing' towards a 'transhistorical linguistic idealism' are 'better understood [as] a kind of passage [] outside of the dualism of self and other into an unsettled and unsettling region'. Like pre-Socratic sophistry, Romantic fragments and fragmentary texts demand an open-ended, ceaseless, 'back-and-forth movement' that resists closure to 'keep oneself open and moving on'. By revitalising 'the idea (embedded within Plato's dialogues) of the fragmentary work [as] dialogue', Strathman traces a literary and philosophical line of influence from the English writings of Laurence Sterne and the ideas of German Romanticism to the British Romantic project of Byron's Don Juan, James Joyce's modernist experimentations 'at the limits of Romantic poetry' and, finally, Blanchot's postmodernist encounters with Friedrich Nietzsche and historical crisis. …",Romance | Romanticism | Literature | Poetry | Philosophy | SOCRATES | Irony | Cartesian anxiety | Art | Political sociology | Law | Politics | Political science,https://openalex.org/W1546306670,0.0,,OpenAlex,12

Beginning as far back as the late 1960s, Maurice Blanchot’s right-wing journalism became a subject of debate, even as the writer’s reputation was rising. It continued to rise, as did the level of scrutiny given to his prewar politics, notably in the 1980s when, as with other figures such as Martin Heidegger and Paul de Man, calls were heard demanding an account of the past (Jeffrey Mehlman’s work at that time is important in this regard). In recent years, a number of publications have shed light on the complex and ambiguous thing called “Blanchot’s politics,” including French editions of his postwar political writings, followed by a translation from Fordham UP in 2010, and Jean-Luc Nancy’s Maurice Blanchot: Passion politique (2011), which presents a long letter Blanchot wrote to Roger Laporte narrating (rather evasively) his activities in the late 1930s. Cahiers de l’Herne on Blanchot, which includes a number of relevant documents, and an issue of Lignes (no 43) entitled Les politiques de Maurice Blanchot 1930–1993, both appeared in 2014. The director of Lignes, Michel Surya, there published a long essay in two parts (or“séquences”) entitled“L’autre Blanchot.”This essay has now been augmented with a third section and published as a book under the same title. The book’s subtitle (“l’écriture de jour, l’écriture de nuit”) quotes a phrase that Blanchot uses in the letter to Laporte to describe his dual writing life, particularly in the 1930s, one for journalism and political engagement, the other for literature. Surya has stated in an interview that this letter is what motivated him to write the book. Why? Partly because, as a result of David Uhrig’s persistent search for heretofore missing articles from the 1930s and the early 1940s, we can see that in that 1984 letter to Laporte, Blanchot tells an outright lie. He claims, emphatically, to have immediately and categorically refused Pétain and the Vichy regime, whereas we now know that in July 1940 Blanchot was director of Aux Écoutes, which under his name published editorials that were unambiguously pro-Vichy (or rather “maréchaliste” as Uhrig and Surya prefer to say) following Pétain’s installation. Surya, a longtime intellectual supporter and friend of Blanchot, finds himself stung into the task of a densely argued—if at times somewhat rapid, breathless, and exclamatory—examination of Blanchot’s political engagements as a whole, from his 1930s extreme-right nationalism to a postwar attack on de Gaulle in 1958 and a vindication of revolution and communism around 1968, to a final, more diffuse period after 1968 (these three phases corresponding to the book’s three “séquences”). Surya motivates his discussion by turning Blanchot’s own condemnation of Heidegger against Blanchot: “Il y a eu corruption d’écriture, abus, travestissement et détournement du langage. Sur lui pèsera dorénavant un soupçon” (13). Far from a simple condemnation, this investigation measures the weight of this suspicion, and pushes further into the difficult question of this major writer’s refusals and responsibilities.

Mas o que seria uma escrita improrrogável? Maurice Blanchot, em sua tessitura, apresenta-nos a partir de seus textos ensaísticos que o escrever é fazer da coisa uma imagem que, longe de representá-la, retrata sua ausência, sua impossibilidade de ser sempre a mesma, sua instabilidade no tempo e sua falta de significação. Escrever, portanto, é denunciar o vazio que se esconde por detrás de cada palavra. Lidamos neste texto com uma concepção bastante especial da escrita, esta literatura Improrrogável que resiste aos tempos sombrios vivenciados em nossos dias.

Ele desaparece, em seu sentido convencional. O autor está morto. Mas quem escreve? No sentido blanchotiano, a morte do autor está relacionada à ausência do condutor todo-poderoso que fala a linguagem do dictare. Isto é, produzir o discurso que pede obediência e oferece descanso, “que só demanda a docilidade e promete o grande repouso da surdez interior”.Palavras-chave: Escrita; Morte; Silêncio; Impossibilidade; Blanchot. AbstractThe present text seeks to draw a dialogue based on the notion of writing, silence of the Blanchotian literature of thought, in which this writing is presented as an irreplaceable literature. But what would be a non-extendable writing? Maurice Blanchot, in his tessitura, shows us from his essay texts that writing is to make of the thing an image that, far from representing it, portrays its absence, its impossibility to be always the same, its instability in time And its lack of significance. Writing, therefore, is denouncing the emptiness that hides behind every word. We deal in this text with a rather special conception of writing that is this Improrable literature, which resists the dark times experienced in our day. This idea was outlined in this work through the Blanchotian conceptions that in this article we call an Improrable literature, questioning the important figure of the writer, or the author, considering that Maurice Blanchot makes no distinction between the two terms. It disappears, in its conventional sense. The author is dead. But who writes? In the blanchotiano sense, the death of the author is related to the absence of the all-powerful conductor who speaks the language of dictare. That is, to produce the discourse that calls for obedience and offers rest, ""which only demands docility and promises the great repose of inner deafness"".Keywords: Writing; Death; Silence; Impossibility; Blanchot.",Aesthetics | Humanities | Philosophy | Silence,https://openalex.org/W2603542790,0.0,,OpenAlex,12

With this in mind, it might also translate Achille Mbembe's efforts to write ‘la nuit-du-monde-africain-postcolonial’ (‘the night-of-the-postcolonial-African-world’). Postcolonial Africa is indeed, like Blanchot's disaster, a starless night, a place of catastrophic ruin, a time in which time itself has succumbed to catastrophe.

The questions that haunt European literature and politics after the horrors of Auschwitz, which is the dominant point of reference for Blanchot's The Writing of the Disaster , are in many ways the same questions we feel compelled to ask about Africa, not only in terms of the historical trauma of slavery and colonialism, or the barely comprehensible ongoing tragedies afflicting the African continent, but also in relation to events that are directly comparable to the Holocaust, such as the Rwandan genocide of 1994.

Or at least, in a gesture towhich Christophe Bident, Leslie Hill, and Michael Holland have in particular drawn our attention, he seems to have enjoyed encoding references to its date, or near-misses, in and around his works, sometimes even in the date of their dept lgal. It is then perhaps especially fitting,for all the complexity of his rigorous reflections on the question ofmemory, that the centenary ofBlanchot's birth, celebrated inSeptember 2007, should have produced some notable acts of commemoration, including a Cerisy colloque (held in July2007) and thepublication byGallimard of a volume of his early, and previously uncollected, literarycriticism. If the current volume pre-dates these festivities, it comes nevertheless as a welcome indication of the depth, range, and quality of the critical work towhich Blanchot's writings are now consistently giving rise.The collection has itsorigins in the conference 'Blanchot, theObscure' held in Melbourne inAugust 2004, where a number of itsessays were firstgiven. Featuring many of themost significant established Blanchot critics, it also includes thework of younger researchers; and both constituencies do much to indicate the ability of Blanchot's work to engage a diverse range of referencepoints. A good number of the essays here, taken collectively, demonstrate the detail and force of the intersections between Blanchot and such interlocutors, familiar and more unexpected, as Paul de Man, Baudelaire, Holderlin, Jean Paul, Melville, Kierkegaard, or Giorgio Caproni. In a characteristically incisive account of Blanchot's (non-)concept of the 'neuter', Christophe Bident traces the filiations-acknowledged and otherwise-from Blan chot to Barthes, and sets these compellingly in the context ofwhat he presents as Blanchot's ethical search: for a just way of being in theworld. Robert Antelme is of course, as Bident shows, a decisive figurehere; this essential connection is deve loped further, with the crucial addition of Blanchot's reflections on 'Etre juif', by Christopher Fynsk, in a typically sensitive and tenacious discussion of Blanchot's 'L'Indestructible'. Elsewhere, Leslie Hill unfolds with contagious urgency the ex treme demands made by Blanchot's approach to that strange thing called literature on contemporary literarycriticism (demands which emerge as, to say the least, perti nent to the crisis inwhich thisdiscipline plainly finds itself,but which it isdesperate to ignore); Kevin Hart pursues what isemerging as a truly indispensable enquiry into Blanchot's relation toparticular elements of Judaeo-Christian thought and practice (here, with specific and extremely rich reference to iconoclasm); Michael Holland provides an exemplary reading of the significance of Blanchot's manceuvrings in re lation to dates, bringing out with supreme rigour the intimate connections between tiny textual details and themost imposing historical contexts. The collection closes with theextraordinary reflectionsprovoked in sculptor Elizabeth Presa-whose work features on its cover-by Blanchot, here alongside Rilke and Rodin. Overall, this volume is a rich resource, and strangely heartening. If our time, afterBlanchot, is MLR, I03.2, 2oo8 55 I once more a time of need, the kind of thinking this collection brings within reach nevertheless turns thenecessity toendure it into a kind of good fortune.

Calum Watt begins his study of the obliquely felt presence of the cinematographic in the thought and writing of Maurice Blanchot with a miniature allegory: he cites an extract from the ﬁrst version () of Blanchot’s novel omas L’obscur which evokes fascination before the ﬂickering images of a cinema screen. It is in Blanchot ’s more general conception of such fascination that Watt ﬁnds the momentum for what might appear, at ﬁrst glance, an unlikely study (the cited passage, aer all, and the most direct statement concerning cinema made by Blanchot, did not itself survive the author’s massive cuts for the  version of the novel). In asking the reader to pause with him and frequently to return to this spectral scene of cinematographic fascination, Watt is asking us to accept as a central generative moment in the book’s conception an at once present and absent passage from Blanchot’s ‘self-unworking’ work. e ﬁrst of Watt’s self-styled ‘case study’ chapters is devoted to Jean-Luc Godard . In a pivotal moment (section ) of Histoire(s) du cinéma (–) Godard juxtaposes (in sequence) a rare photograph of Blanchot, taken without its subject’s permission by a paparazzo in , and a still of the eponymous vampire from Murnau’s Nosferatu. e sequence concludes with Godard’s own voice reading a passage from Blanchot’s L’Amitié, and it is this combination of citations that enables Watt to ﬁnd a Blanchotian reasoning in the infamous juxtaposition in Histoire(s) of a still from George Stevens’s A Place in the Sun (speciﬁcally Elizabeth Taylor) and images of Auschwitz. It is an original, complex, and detailed argument which Watt successfully executes—albeit with some complicated and occasionally obtrusive signposting back and forth. With the subjects of the two other case studies, the Hungarian director Béla Tarr and representative of the so-called new French extremity (a contested term) Gaspard Noé, there is no such embedded point of reference to Blanchot to draw upon. e qualities of each that suggest the applicability of conceptual reframing MLR, .,   derived from Blanchot are, according to Watt, as follows: in an attention, ﬁrst, to Tarr’s use of landscape and empty (more speciﬁcally the emptied or emptying sets as humans disappear into them or take leave of them in front of a static camera) and, second, to the temporal conceit announced in the title of Noé’s ﬁlm Irréversible (). In the case of Tarr’s Satantango (), prolonged passages of exegesis and patient scholarly synthesis allow Watt to claim that the ﬁlm and Tarr’s production in general work by means of a fascination which produces Blanchotian worklessness (désœuvrement), a conception Watt admirably sums up with the idea that in fascination as thought of by Blanchot no thing does the fascinating. Of the three, the chapter on the oen maligned Irréversible is the least successful. Aside from the challenge involved in considering the notorious underpass rape scene (which lasts eleven minutes in the ﬁlm) as one where the viewer is stuck, fascinated, in an immobilized present, the ‘spectral passer-by’ central to Watt’s argument is in fact one of two digital post-production treatments...",Advertising | Allegory | Argument (complex analysis) | Art | Art history | Biochemistry | Business | Character (mathematics) | Chemistry | Criticism | Dialectic | Epistemology | Geometry | Intertextuality | Literature | Mathematics | Movie theater | Painting | Philosophy | Physics | Poetics | Poetry | Power (physics) | Quantum mechanics | Section (typography) | Watt,https://openalex.org/W4210423834,0.0,,OpenAlex,12

Mark Hewson. London: Continuum, 2011. Pp. xx + 150. $90.00 (cloth); $27.95 (paper). Blanchot and Literary Criticism is a series of studies that offers erudite analyses of several texts in which Maurice Blanchot approaches works by “modern” writers. Hewson focuses primarily on Blanchot’s writings published in the collections Faux pas (1943), La Part du feu (The Work of Fire, 1949), L’Espace littéraire (The Space of Literature, 1955), and Le Livre à venir (The Book to Come, 1959), and in so doing he isolates the work that is most recognizably critical in its approach. During the period covered by Hewson, Blanchot was also writing “fictions,” and from the following collection of essays onwards (L’Entretien infini; The Infinite Conversation, 1969), it is even more difficult to categorize Blanchot’s writing as it integrates sections of dialogue and becomes increasingly concerned with its own fragmentation. After an initial chapter looking at Blanchot’s understanding of modern literature, the second and third chapters analyze his readings of Hölderlin and Mallarmé respectively, and the fourth and fifth chapters for the most part provide an account of Blanchot’s thought as a counterpoint to Martin Heidegger’s. Taken individually, Hewson’s studies are models of good scholarship and often bring great insight, albeit to quite familiar terrain. The individual studies of Blanchot’s work on Hölderlin and Mallarmé are extremely welcome additions to the field and provide an excellent resource for scholars seeking to orient themselves in these complex areas. The fourth chapter is perhaps the high point of the work; Hewson ranges over a constellation of texts to present a supple analysis of what Blanchot saw as the fundamental ambiguity of the negating power of language. In this and the next chapter, Heidegger’s text is set beside Blanchot’s so that the two bodies of work illuminate each other, yet neither is reduced to the other. Despite many good reasons to read this book, however, there are still a couple of areas that I found problematic. My major concern is the overall purpose of the book and the way its thesis is framed; it constantly risks slipping into incoherence. The book’s title certainly announces an enormous question: what relation does Blanchot’s work maintain with literary criticism? This is not, however, quite the question that Hewson’s pieces ask, and he somewhat sidesteps it by pursuing a derivative issue, asking why Blanchot’s work has not been more consistently taken up in “literary studies” (see introduction). In the introduction, which joins the conclusion as one of the least satisfying parts of the book, there is no indication of why he uses the term “literary criticism” in [End Page 163] his title. Where is this critical absence? In France, for example, it would be difficult to overstate the extent of Blanchot’s influence in thinking about literature in postwar scholarship. Blanchot’s supposed absence from the field of literary criticism has the feel of a false problem that has been constructed to give the volume the role of mediating his writings to a larger public, or perhaps, as I will suggest below (and the two hypotheses are not mutually exclusive), the title is a residue from earlier thinking about the work, thinking that became less and less tenable as the research progressed. The key issue, I would suggest, is not so much a simple absence in the field, but the infinitely complex relation between Blanchot’s work and the discipline of literary criticism. The question of that relation is something that Blanchot reflects on. In the famous note at the beginning of L’Entretien infini, he speaks of the “Book” and of its supersession by a kind of “writing” for which the name Mallarmé stands as an index. The reader understands that Blanchot’s work is itself implied in this movement beyond the “Book,” a movement that, according to Hewson, “always indicates an order that submits to unity, a system of notions in which are affirmed the primacy of speech over writing, of thought over language, and the promise of a communication that...",Acoustics | Art | Counterpoint | Criticism | Humanities | Linguistics | Literary criticism | Literature | Philosophy | Physics,https://openalex.org/W2056385415,0.0,,OpenAlex,12
10.1353/pmc.2002.0023,"Blanchot, Narration, and the Event",Lars Iyer,,2002,2002-05-01,Postmodern Culture,,article,en,False,"Blanchot, Narration, and the Event Lars Iyer Abstract In this paper, I explore the contribution of Blanchot’s notion of narration to the so-called “narrative turn” in the humanities. The turn in question is aimed at foregrounding the importance of narrative in the construction of selves and communities. Narrativists focus on the way in which experience is structured through the narrative interconnection of elements in a meaningful sequence. They are often drawn to literary criticism, in which attention to narrative structures has always been important. But literary critics often posit a contrast between a narrated event and the subsequent constitution of the event through narrative representation, and it is this contrast that many narrativists want to overturn. I argue that Blanchot’s non-representational account of literature offers a more productive notion of the relationship between narrative and event since it does not depend on this contrast. Trust the tale, not the teller—but what if the identity of the teller is given in the articulation of the tale? What if there would be not only no tale without a teller, but no teller without a tale? What if tale and teller were bound up in an interdependence that is far more complex than hitherto supposed? The “narrative turn” in the humanities is born of an insistence that there are modes of experience that cannot be captured by a theory that would transcend the historicity of experience.1 It calls for a new concretion, a new plunge into existence through the examination of the way in which experiences are meaningfully interconnected as elements in a sequence. In this sense, as David Carr argues in an admirable book, narrative is not a later imposition on pre-narrative experience but constitutes experience itself.2 To posit the real as something that is experienced and only thereafter narrated is to misunderstand the way in which human behavior is directed toward the achievement of projected ends. The turn in question might appear to strike a great blow for the freedom of human beings to determine their existence for themselves. Likewise, the appeal to a new understanding of the role of narrativity seems to permit communities to redefine their place in the world.3 But communities themselves are vulnerable to powerful reactionary forces, and individuals, as narrativists show, are never to be considered in isolation from the communities that shape and inform their values.4 It is always possible for certain fundamentalist elements to invoke a hidden but originary orthodoxy, regulating the lives of “insiders” and governing their attitude to “outsiders.” But what is it that permits communities to, as it were, fold in upon themselves, submitting themselves to the enforcement of programmable, carefully regulated behavior? No doubt the drive to unify, to relate everything back to a point of origin, is a liability inherent to all forms of narration. In this sense, it might be possible to invoke a grand narrative that unifies all other narratives, a broader, deeper story that always aims to perpetuate a reassuring order, regulating the relationship between members of a community and between that community and others. In The Postmodern Condition, Lyotard tells us that the age of the grand récit has passed, but perhaps the grandest tale of them all—the tale that is told in the elaboration of any tale—still exerts its dominion. In this way, the narrative turn risks granting dignity to a debilitating and demobilizing story of the dominance of hegemonies and elites. It becomes necessary, therefore, as part of this turn to rethink narration, treating it, as Linda Singer recommends of community, not as “a referential sign” but as “a call or appeal” (125). The turn in question calls for provocative responses, for attempts to resist the prevailing determination of meaning and value. Maurice Blanchot, I will suggest, shows us how we might respond to an appeal inherent in the desire to narrate that would permit us to articulate a different relationship to the dominating narratives of our time. In some of his most vehement and programmatic pages, he argues that there is a desire indissociable from Western civilization (indeed, it could be said to constitute civilization itself) to recount its...",Art | Astrophysics | Event (particle physics) | History | Literature | Narrative | Physics,https://openalex.org/W2053315848,4.0,,OpenAlex,12

Yet, as this paper will argue, space seems less to do with geographical, political, or socio-cultural factors, and more to do with what French writer and critic Maurice Blanchot calls the ‘space of literature’ – the ineffable place of origin of any work of art. In House of Leaves , a mysterious and ever-shifting labyrinth is unexpectedly found inside and below a house, which causes extreme feelings of disorientation and discomfort to anyone who enters it. This strange place of the story seems particularly identifiable with Blanchot’s space: a space of impossible geography, of blackness, and nothingness. However, since the voice of art speaks solely from here, the artist must necessarily engage with its perturbing discovery to be able to create. Not only does the novel evoke Blanchot’s view, it strikingly echoes other similar musings on the workings of literature, such as those put forward by Samuel Beckett, whose presence in the text is also tangible.",Nothing | Space (punctuation) | Creativity | Politics | Feeling | Aesthetics | Art | Literature | Philosophy | Art history | Epistemology | Psychology | Law | Linguistics | Social psychology | Political science,https://openalex.org/W2769460655,0.0,,OpenAlex,12

After briefly going back on this complex and polysemous notion, we discoverthrough the different chapters the deep imprints that both Franz Kafka and Paul Celan left onBlanchot’s work around this « fragmentary experience », which the three authors each livedaccording to different modalities.The first part of the work shows the links uniting the various authors so as to explore in the secondpart the common features to the three fragmentary writings.

One of the contributions of this research is that itredefines the fragmentary genre as a full-fledged style. Further more, the whole of the work is enhanced by annexes bringing together in particular some of Blanchot’s manuscripts.

Coetzee. Taking the critical theory of Maurice Blanchot as its touchstone on im-personal-ity, the essay aims to uncover how Coetzee’s writing simultaneously negotiates and foregrounds a middle ground between the personal and impersonal as well as between persons and personalities, which issues in the construction of works of art that are personally impersonal in a way that distinguishes authors like Coetzee and Blanchot from others who are, perhaps, more interested in their own personal expression and ‘celebrity.’ Starting with an analysis of these matters as they appear in his memoir-novels, this essay ultimately pursues the consummation of this impersonal discourse and the work of writing in Coetzee’s most recent novel, The Childhood of Jesus (2013).",Sociology | Work (physics) | Engineering | Mechanical engineering,https://openalex.org/W1605302932,1.0,,OpenAlex,12

Kafka’s greatest admirers include Maurice Blanchot and Jean-Paul Sartre, both of whom consider his work an exemplary illustration of their own poetical-philosophical views. This is remarkable, because Blanchot’s and Sartre’s respective views are generally conceived of as opposites. Apparently, then, these two authors who are so divergent in their philosophical views and literary criticism, as well as in their own literary works, find themselves on the same page in their appreciation of Kafka. I will argue that this shared appreciation not only reveals some unexpected points of agreement between them, but also facilitates an interesting intellectual encounter between Blanchot and Sartre in the late 1940 s. It is, we will see, only on the basis of an agreement with regards to Kafka’s work that their ways can part.",Art | Criticism | Epistemology | Existentialism | Linguistics | Literary criticism | Literature | Philosophy | Psychoanalysis | Psychology,https://openalex.org/W3105607310,0.0,,OpenAlex,12

,Reading the Philippians “Christ-hymn” Alongside Blanchot’s Orpheus and Kristeva’s Dead Christ,Andrew Wilson,,2011,2011-04-20,The Bible and Critical Theory,,article,en,,"This essay begins by observing that traditional readings of the so-called Christ-hymn, from Paul’s letter to the Philippians, typically support and sustain traditional theological formulations. The problem is that these formulations tend be more philosophical in character and consequently sideline the poetic dimension/experience of this text. This essay then seeks to interpret the hymn precisely in those poetic terms that are routinely marginalized in scholarship. Reclaimed, this facet of the text proves to be a powerful contributing factor to theological discourse in a way that conditions its traditionally philosophical character. As a point of comparison, the myth of Orpheus and Eurydice as interpreted by French literary theorist Maurice Blanchot is read alongside the narrative pattern present in the hymn. In his reading, Blanchot links affective “literary” or poetic experience with the “impossible” and ultimately with death. A similar pattern is at work in the hymn, where at the heart of this poetic text, the moment of death is rendered unpresentable. The reading is further aided by the psychoanalytic theoretical work of Julia Kristeva, particularly her reading of Holbein’s The Body of the Dead Christ in the Tomb. Ultimately, what becomes clear is that reading the hymn involves playing out the human confrontation with otherness in a way that puts the death of Jesus at the very centre of this psychic drama.",Hymn | Literature | Poetry | Reading (process) | Revelation | Philosophy | Scholarship | Mythology | Narrative | Theology | Psychoanalytic theory | Art | Psychoanalysis | Psychology | Linguistics | Political science | Law,https://openalex.org/W1936145110,0.0,,OpenAlex,12

Deleuze’s thought in the late 60s, then, should be read as an intervention in postwar attempts to articulate a Hegel-Heidegger synthesis by determining the nature and structure of transcendence.

10.1080/14735784.2010.496594,Naming the Nothing: Nancy and Blanchot on Community,Ian James,,2010,2010-07-01,"Culture, theory and critique/Culture, theory & critique",,article,en,False,"Abstract This article examines the exchange between Jean‐Luc Nancy and Maurice Blanchot around the question of community. It argues that Nancy from the early 1980s onwards offers an understanding of community as an exposure to, or of, a nothing or empty space. This nothing or empty space can be understood as the space left vacant by the withdrawal of any transcendent principle which would underpin or guarantee various forms of political organization or historical becoming. Whether it be the absence of any divine principle which would legitimate monarchical or imperial authority, or the absence of any essence or goal for the human in history (e.g. the bonds of national community or communism), the ‘nothing’ of community is exposed in the wake of the withdrawal or retreat of political transcendence. Blanchot’s response to Nancy’s essay ‘La Communauté désœuvrée’, entitled La Communauté inavouable is critical of Nancy’s thinking on this subject but, this article argues, he is critical only insofar as he shares with Nancy the problem of thinking, naming, or exposing the ‘nothing’ of community. The difference of these two key French thinkers about this question reminds us that ethical and political stakes of thinking community in the absence of metaphysical ground are always a matter of thinking community as absence. It also remind us that this thinking of community occurs in the experience of the ‘community of writing.’",Communism | Computer science | Environmental ethics | Epistemology | Law | Library science | Linguistics | Metaphysics | Nothing | Philosophy | Political science | Politics | Sociology | Space (punctuation) | Subject (documents) | Transcendence (philosophy),https://openalex.org/W2012747107,13.0,,OpenAlex,12

Through readings of theoretical essays by Bataille, his annotated edition of Laure's Le Sacre (published illegally in 1939, only months after the author's death, and distributed clandestinely to a restricted group of readers), and Blanchot's La Communaute inavouable, I argue that Laure's book functions as the literary analogue to two avant-garde communities in which Laure and Bataille were involved - Acephale and the College of Sociology - and that this same book is at the heart of the unavowable community theorized by Blanchot. Bataille's justification for publishing Laure's writings echoes the very terms he uses to describe his group projects of the late 1930s: community, communication, the sacred, sacrifice. I argue that, in publishing and distributing her book, Bataille effectively sanctifies Laure, turning her into a martyr for the community. However, in contrast to Acephale and the College of Sociology, the community founded over Laure's dead body was a virtual community: one based on the members' solitary experiences of reading.

Blanchot and the Moving Image: Fascination and Spectatorship. Legenda, 2017. In The Emergence of Cinematic Time: Modernity, Contingency, the Archive (2002), Mary Ann Doane not only maps the new technology's historical context—masterfully analyzing cinema's place in the constellation of such nineteenth-century discourses as thermodynamics, eugenics, statistic, and psychoanalysis—but also evokes, perhaps unwittingly, a dominant trope that has organized film theory since its beginning. This trope conveys what a psychoanalytically minded reader might call the ""ambivalence"" that has inflected the reception of cinema. On the one hand, the new technology was welcomed with enthusiasm for various reasons, among them its seeming ability to alleviate the cruelties of human finitude: the promise that, with the new re-presentational capacity, ""death will have ceased to be absolute"" (qtd. in Doane 62), that those whom we have lost will live on in lifelike simulacra. On the other hand, what Doane calls ""this fascination with the technologically supported ability to inscribe time"" (63) readily slipped into an anxiety about cinema's potentially malevolent influence, often informed by the perceived kinship between film spectatorship and the histories of hypnosis and mesmerism. Commentators who made this connection—who saw in cinema dangers that would be allegorized in Robert Weise's The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari and Fritz Lang's Dr. Mabuse—introduced a vocabulary to film theory that has remained with us ever since. Doane continues this tradition by tracking the ways in which the unease of early commentators was elicited by ""the fascination"" of cinema (108), the ""pleasure and fascination"" of film viewing (107). This infectiously recurrent word, I propose, is important: since the late nineteenth century, observers of the new art have again and again returned to contemplate, in Ackbar Abbas's phrase, ""the fascination of the cinematic"" (363). As Doane's analysis suggests, the history of film theory is a history of fascination. Following early commentators' routine references to what Hugo Münsterberg in 1916 called cinema's ""strange fascination"" (221), critics of the culture industry in postwar Europe would frequently discern in popular culture the mechanism of ideological enthrallment, a bondage that the word ""fascination,"" with its long and resonant history in Western discourses, readily suggested. Theodor Adorno spoke of the ""programmatic fascination"" with which popular culture's distractions snared individuals into a ""bewitched reality"" (""On the Fetish-Character"" 276; Aesthetic Theory 227). While the Birmingham School would rethink such dynamics by reconsidering cultural contestations beyond the rigorous schemes of classical Marxism, in the film theory of the late twentieth century, particularly influenced by Lacanian psychoanalysis, Raymond Bellour, Christian Metz, Jean-Louis Baudry, and Laura Mulvey would go on to analyze spectatorial identification with the cinematic image in terms of the audience's ""imaginary"" thrall—frequently, again, ""fascination""—with screen images. The tradition of dissecting ""the fascination of film"" (Mulvey 14) has been more recently continued by Steven Shaviro, Oliver Harris, and Pansy Duncan; in ways that remain to be analyzed, Leo Bersani's commentary on cinema, spread across his extensive oeuvre, similarly unfolds as a theory of fascination. In Blanchot and the Moving Image: Fascination and Spectatorship, Calum Watt positions Maurice Blanchot as an important and overlooked thinker in this genealogy. As Watt notes, Blanchot does not immediately come to mind as a theorist of film. His philosophical interests focus almost exclusively on literary texts; only a few oblique references in his work evince any engagement with cinema. Nevertheless, a number of filmmakers—most notably Jean-Luc Godard, to whom the book's first chapter is devoted—have deployed Blanchot as a point of reference. The task of Blanchot and the Moving Image is to make explicit the relevance of his work to the field of cinema studies. With a thorough knowledge of Blanchot's work and an exquisite sensitivity to the details of his stylistics, Watt does this by elaborating on the concept of ""fascination,"" the nodal point at which film theory and Blanchot's philosophy meet. Even though it is a central and recurring term in his work, ""fascination"" has received...",Aesthetics | Ambivalence | Art | Art history | Enthusiasm | Epistemology | Film theory | Literature | Modernity | Movie theater | Philosophy | Psychoanalysis | Psychology | Temporality | Theology | Trope (literature),https://openalex.org/W2987641086,0.0,,OpenAlex,12

No nos referimos, como se vera, a la aparente ausencia de la lectura de en trabajos o trayectos criticos importantes â€“desmentida por presencias significativas aunque sin dudas contadas-, sino mas bien al lugar incomodo, incidental, en apariencia a veces ausente, que tiene en la ensenanza de la teoria literaria, en las bibliografias de los programas de catedra, pero tambien en las citas de gran parte de los escritos de la critica literaria local. Esta presencia minima y dispersa parece acentuarse con la llamada normalizacion, tras la recuperacion democratica de las instituciones universitarias desde fines de 1983, cuando las lecturas y debates giran en torno de firmas como las de Barthes, Bajtin traducido por los franceses, Kristeva, Foucault, Deleuze o Derrida. En este sentido, es importante destacar que en nuestra tesina de licenciatura hemos rastreado los alcances de la obra de en algunos autores centrales de la teoria literaria extranjera del siglo XX, confirmando la importancia de su influencia (vg. en Foucault, de Man, Culler, Deleuze, Barthes, Derrida, Nancy, Lacoue-Labarthe, RanciA¨re, Agamben, Compagnon).

Wirth SCHUBACK, Marcia Sá Cavalcante. Time in Exile: In Conversation with Heidegger, Blanchot, and Lispector. Albany: State University of New York Press, 2020. x + 172 pp. Cloth, $95.00; paper, $31.95 Although there has been a profusion of studies on exile, of the loss of home and the hunger for return, this beautiful and highly original work investigates the experience of exile from within. How does exile as such reorient our experience of time? Exile is typically construed as exile from a place, from one’s proper home. The exile is consequently nostalgic, longing for the nostos or journey back home. We seek to return to a lost past. But the internal constitution of exile suspends this scheme. Exile is no longer ecstatic, no longer the loss of what one was and consequently standing out, exposed to the future. Rather, the ecstatic constitution of time itself comes to a standstill and becomes static, “a movement without where-from and where-to, the movement of a meanwhile.” It is now the disclosure that there is no home to which to return, that time itself is not on the way from an origin to something new. Exile consequently “is not conceived from the ecstatic scheme of movement as change from-to” but, rather, the “suspended existence in the between and in the meanwhile.” It is no longer movement “as change from one place to another, from one time to another, from one state to another.” Schuback calls the time within exile “gerundive,” that is, neither a “tense” or “voice” but, rather, “a verbal tension,” which expresses “the on-going and whiling in the between.” It is an ongoing home in homelessness. “Existence in exile is, above all, existence exposed to the uncanny is-being, to the bare ‘is-existing.’” The “uncanny” translates unheimlich, which Heidegger so memorably analyzed in Being and Time. This term speaks to the loss of familiarity and the disclosure of strangeness as being no longer at home (Heim). This was not a temporary loss of one’s own but, rather, the disclosure that one has no home, that one is at home in such homelessness. “In exile homelessness without end.” This is the critical but difficult thought: “The uncanniness of home, of the homeland, of the homely came to light and in which home became homeless.” Schuback seeks to articulate this unending exile, that is, “to unfold the experience of gerundive time, of being while being, existing while existing, insofar as this gerundive experience of time corresponds most intimately and intensively to the experience of time within exilic existence.” She does so by engaging three interlocutors, one struggling with the limits of philosophy, another with the limits of writing as such, and the third with a new form of writing that directly confronts gerundive exile. Her first interlocutor is Heidegger, the master of the phenomenological analysis of ecstatic time. In Being and Time, Dasein is disclosed as ecstatic, but as Heidegger’s thought developed, it releases this anthropocentric starting point of an “experience of outsideness” and becomes increasingly aware “of nearness, of presencing, that grows from the insight into the whiling and abiding of being.” Heidegger realized that [End Page 154] “within exile time does not really pass, time remains in the meanwhile, moving without moving the whole past and the whole future.” Schuback’s second interlocutor, Maurice Blanchot, is the thinker par excellence of exile and withdrawal. Blanchot’s writing attempts to write without writing, expansively reiterating the X without X structure, as in to “live without living” or “to die without dying” or a “name without name.” Writing is a “continuous entrance into where one already is.” His fragmentary writing guards the absence of meaning neither because an original meaning has come and gone nor as a placeholder for a meaning still to come. Rather, “this meaning is the withdrawing itself,” an “immobile becoming.” As Michel Foucault presciently realized, Blanchot’s practice of writing finally severs time from the stranglehold of subjectivity, beyond either absence or presence but, rather, in the neutral time, the neither-nor...",Aesthetics | Algorithm | Art | Art history | Computer science | Constitution | Conversation | Humanities | Law | Linguistics | Literature | Movement (music) | Philosophy | Political science | Religious studies | State (computer science) | Theology,https://openalex.org/W4293169586,0.0,,OpenAlex,12

I provide a close reading of passages from Blanchot’s <italic>The Last Man</italic> (1957) to reflect on what happens at the limit-experience of characterization itself. However, these literary examples from Blanchot do not translate evidently into guidelines for an everyday liveable “third” or impersonal personhood that Esposito estimates would follow from an “affirmative biopolitics.” Instead, I discuss what might be instances of “fourth personhood,” where personification is extended to objects or used in situations where the limits of personhood are not clear. These cases of “fourth” personhood point towards a more ecological sense of how personifications can be distributed across landscapes, taking up Esposito’s challenge to imagine a future sense of person and politics that is not subordinated to the logic of a controlling biopolitics.",Art | Biopower | Epistemology | Law | Literature | Neutrality | Personhood | Philosophy | Political science | Politics | Psychoanalysis | Psychology | Sociology | Third person,https://openalex.org/W4317827248,0.0,,"Crossref, OpenAlex",12

What catches his attention concerning the renewal of Sade in France after the Second World War, I argue, is a form of literature animated by the impossible – that is, weakness, dispossession, and inoperativity –, which undermines the logic of representation at the basis of anthropocentric and humanist subjectivity. I proceed to elucidate Beckett’s translations of excerpts from Maurice Blanchot and Georges Bataille on Sade, with an emphasis on the question of sovereignty on its aesthetic, ethical, political, ontological, and literary registers. Their readings critically reassess the modern biopolitical configuration of sovereign power and violence that reduces human life to nothing, all the while tracing a certain excess of being that traverses the language of Sade’s body of work. This notably sovereign excess, when displaced in the space of literature, dismantles the self-sufficient and autonomous subject on the one hand and taps into an insurgent potential of revolt on the other. My contention is that Beckett’s hitherto unpublished translations convey what he shares in common, albeit from a distance, with Blanchot and Bataille after Sade, alongside a wider counter-current of late modernist literature attuned to writing, thinking, and living from the standpoint of the impossible.",Aesthetics | Anthropocentrism | Archaeology | Art | Context (archaeology) | Environmental ethics | Epistemology | History | Humanism | Law | Literature | Nothing | Philosophy | Political science | Politics | Representation (politics) | Sovereignty | Subjectivity | Theology,https://openalex.org/W4283764638,0.0,,"Crossref, OpenAlex",12

Allen What is perhaps most profoundly significant about Maurice Blanchot's writings, both fictional and critical, is that they appear to harbour a mode of ontological thought that arises from outside philosophy. This is not just a rethinking of the nature of literature but a way of thinking ontology more generally that proceeds from literature. That is, Blanchot seems to come to an understanding of the nature of things as such through his work on literary things. Consequently, his thought also has implications for ontology as a branch of philosophy since it arises from the ostensibly non-philosophical sphere of literature. To examine this hypothesis I will look at Blanchot's early critical writings and his second novel, Aminadab. Although Aminadab is one of Blanchot's less widely-discussed works it is particularly important because in it he pursues, more forcefully and perhaps more effectively than in Thomas l'Obscur (his first novel), a thorough interrogation of the space of literature as an ""imaginary"" space, that is, a space of images. This is possible because Aminadab bears a consistent narrative, rather than the series of discrete episodes in Thomas l'Obscur, and as a result Blanchot is able for the first time to develop a narrative whose structure and space are fully integrated. It is this inter-relation that is the basis for his more condensed narratives or récits after the war and thus the writing of Aminadab represents a key development in his early works. As I will show in section one of this essay, a key impetus for Blanchot's attempt to write in this uniquely integrated manner was the challenge he saw issued by Mallarmé's idea of literature. Mallarmé was a pivotal figure for Blanchot's early [End Page 1098] writings because he saw that the peculiar nature and status of literature, as comprising a space of images that was absolute, was an issue of the greatest philosophical and ontological significance. Not only did this mean that literature should be treated as a serious mode of philosophical enquiry in itself but that the nature of literary space was singular in the extreme. What, Blanchot seems to have thought, are the implications of such an extremity, not just for literature, but in general? Necessarily, such an extreme singularity would affect how we approach literature and how it relates to us and from this comes the idea of literature as absolutely indifferent, for Blanchot finds that the space of literature has its own existence, a ""life"" of its own, that will become formulated not just through Hegel's sentence about the life of the Spirit enduring death and maintaining itself in it (which is central to his 1947-48 essay ""La littérature et le droit à la mort"") but also as a survival, an impersonal living on or ""afterlife"" [survivre], that surpasses any biological concept of life. It is thus that literature becomes an alien, neutre force, absolute and ""workless"" [désoeuvrée], but through its effects on the imagination it is able to draw us into an uncertain relation to its indifference. The role of the imagination thus becomes critical, for it is by way of the imagination that the literary space of images makes itself known to us in its indifference. As a consequence it is necessary to look at the status of the imagination more closely and it is very likely that Blanchot's understanding of it was influenced by Heidegger's reading of Kant (Heidegger §§ 19-23).1 If so, it would seem that two aspects of Heidegger's version of Kant have become significant for Blanchot: firstly, the role that the imagination plays in integrating or synthesising the manifold of sensory intuitions and the concepts of the understanding; and secondly, the notion of the image as an autonomous appearing, a presencing at a distance, that ""looks"" at us and which is both apprehended and schematised by the imagination. Key for Heidegger in this regard is the fact that this look is not of a pre-given object but is rather the mode of the object's appearance, since the imagination...",Absolute (philosophy) | Absolute time and space | Archaeology | Art | Computer science | Database | Epistemology | History | Interrogation | Linguistics | Literature | Narrative | Ontology | Philosophy | Physics | Psychoanalysis | Psychology | Relation (database) | Space (punctuation) | The Imaginary | Theoretical physics | Theory of relativity,https://openalex.org/W2004741184,0.0,,OpenAlex,12

The negativity that informs the unsayable thus acts as a double for the said and, while this negative force remains silent, its traceable impact can be felt. For 20th Century French authors Georges Bataille and Maurice Blanchot, silence is a force that undoes writing, leaving the unsayable exposed in the text. Bataille confronts the unsayable when his inner experience leads him into a dead end, 'where all possibilities are exhausted and the impossible prevails'. For Maurice Blanchot, the writer 'belongs to a language that no-one speaks, that is addressed to no-one, that has no centre, [and] that reveals nothing'. For both authors, the writing process must sabotage itself if the unsayable is to be heard. But what of the visual artist who confronts the negativity of the unsayable? On Kawara, whose work is the subject of a restrospective at the Guggenheim called 'On Kawara –Silence', is a Japanese artist known for his daily date paintings, consisting of the date painted in white letters on a black background. Each new canvas is accompanied by a subtitle, gleaned from newspaper headlines of events occurring that day. Kawara's choice of subtitles bespeaks his interest in 'tragedy, violence, and death'. Indeed, despite their apparent tautological nature, his date paintings reveal much more than they appear to say. For Bataille, Blanchot, and Kawara – despite their different choice of media – the unsayable and silence are hinged to the negativity which is time.

To achieve the common in community, Blanchot argues for the development of unworking writing practices aimed at the silence anterior to language—a silence that constitutes authentic communication. Instead of abiding by the rules of grammar, Blanchot encourages writers to produce fragments. This fragmentation causes fissures in the structures of language, giving way to an original silence that has the potential to found our future communities absent principles of sovereignty. With a sensitivity to the ways that silence has been forced onto historically marginalized communities, I will explore Blanchot's theory of unworking toward silence. Recognizing that there are undesirable modes of silence that cohere and sustain communities, I will offer an element of nuance to Blanchot's strategy of fragmentary writing toward the silence anterior to language: the process of unworking in fragmentation, if it is to successfully avoid compounding forms of oppression, must first pass through silenced communities whose histories have been forcibly fragmented.

Baumgarten, laying the groundwork for much of the “distribution of the sensible” that dominated the field of aesthetics after him, conceives of the poem as the paradigmatic instance of an aesthetic cognition of the sensible that is founded on the triad of clarity, attention, and liveliness. He thus opposes the poem to both the obscure fundus animae, the ground of the soul, and to utopian poetry, neither of which can be poetized. By contrast, Blanchot’s literature dissolves this triple foundation into a writing of obscurity, distracted fatigue, and a “death resurrected”; literature opens aesthetics to that which had been constitutively excluded at its founding moment.

The second uproots and refuses the instantiation of any order, which is Sade’s conception of insurrection. The article argues that Blanchot’s enigmatic notion of the “moment of revolution” is the point in which the negation of the law has reached its extreme point and transitions into insurrection. Further, this article contends that the moment of revolution, for Blanchot, is not a condition external to writing but intrinsic to literature as such. This article will elaborate the argument by annotating “Insurrection” with two of Blanchot’s allegories for literature: his retellings of Kafka’s “The Burrow” and the myth of Orpheus and Eurydice. By constellating these allegories with Blanchot’s reading of Sade and highlighting their shared thematic structural properties, the article aims to demonstrate that “Insurrection,” too, should be read as an allegory of literature. Ultimately, at stake is an understanding of how Blanchot theorizes a revolutionary potentiality intrinsic to his conception of literature, which is both latent and fundamental to his various allegories of writing.",Aesthetics | Classical mechanics | Linguistics | Moment (physics) | Movement (music) | Negation | Philosophy | Physics | Political science,https://openalex.org/W4412202900,0.0,,OpenAlex,12

I shall concentrate on that part of the discussion between Nancy and Blanchot where they focus on the way the absent community can be articulated and put into words. Putting it into words implies after all to set the desoeuvrement into work and reveals a tension between work and 'unworking'. Nancy criticizes Bataille for eventually letting the work prevail over the unworking in his approach of the absent community, while he himself advocates the opposite. Blanchot's work can be regarded as a defence of Bataille and therefore partly as a critique on the position of Nancy. Although both of them try to achieve the right balance between work and unworking, Blanchot, in my opinion, is the only one who succeeds in actually preserving the suspense between both aspects.",Psychoanalysis | Balance (ability) | Work (physics) | Philosophy | Humanities | Psychology | Engineering | Mechanical engineering | Neuroscience,https://openalex.org/W1510738968,0.0,,OpenAlex,12

The personal documents of Georges Duthuit—Beckett’s close friend in this period, during the writing of both Three Dialogues (1949) and the ‘Trilogy’ of novels (1951–1953)—shed further light on this connection. They suggest that Three Dialogues is a continuation of Beckett’s decades-long thought on habit, as first articulated in Proust (1930), and that Duthuit (re)introduced Beckett to Blanchot’s work at the time of writing Three Dialogues. This article explores connections between Blanchot’s Thomas l’obscur (1941) and ‘De l’angoisse au langage’ (1943), and published and manuscript versions of Beckett’s Three Dialogues and L’Innommable, as well as between the problematics posed by the latter two texts.

10.1163/15700640260496703,THE INTERRUPTION OF MYTH: A NANCIAN READING OF BLANCHOT AND AL-BAYATI,Mohammad R. Salama,,2002,2002-01-01,Journal of Arabic Literature,,article,en,False,"Abstract Jean-Luc Nancy's provocative second chapter of The Inoperative Community, ""Myth Interrupted,"" sets to redefine the relationship between myth and literature. This paper puts Nancy's new perspective to test through juxtaposing Abd al-Wahhab al-Bayati's myth of Orpheus with Maurice Blanchot's. The assumption is that when literature stages myth and presents it from various perspectives, it does so not to invoke or allegorize its content through the letter, but rather to interrupt it. This new discovery of the ""untraceability"" of myth leaves us with a different perspective of literature as that language which cuts across myth and exposes its limit and as a language that inhabits myth only to interrupt it. Blanchot's interest in Orpheus, as it is articulated in his novel/story Thomas l'obscur (the 1950 New Version) and in his chapter on ""Orpheus's Gaze"" in The Space of Literature, and al-Bayati's reference to Orpheus in his poetic collections He Who Comes and Does Not Come, Death in Life, and Writing on the Mud thematize this playful staging of the myth of Orpheus. Both seem to follow a different path with the same myth. Blanchot disregards the ending of the Orpheus story, and al-Bayati disregards the gaze. However, it is not just selection, but modification that is at work here: both shape their chosen materials in conformity to a specific need. The logic that binds the two writers together in relation to myth and literature expresses itself not only in the choice of the same myth, but they also have in common the shared debt to this classical material and more importantly in their (re)definition of this material. The point of departure between the two of them in their treatment (reinterpretation) of Orpheus is that Blanchot is looking at the effect of death on writing, while al-Bayati is exploring the effect of writing on death.",Aesthetics | Art | Computer science | Conformity | Database | Gaze | History | Linguistics | Literature | Mythology | Perspective (graphical) | Philosophy | Poetry | Psychoanalysis | Psychology | Reading (process) | Relation (database) | Social psychology | Visual arts,https://openalex.org/W2089287515,1.0,,OpenAlex,12

Rather than making a direct comparison, then, Allen shows how these ‘different but parallel œuvres’ (p. 18) resonate in the way they reflect through their form the experience of the world under the sign of disaster.

Reconocidas ubicuamente por su particular vuelo filosófico, las lecturas blanchotianas de la literatura pueden ser llamadas “transversales” en la medida en que eluden la clasificación disciplinar estricta (ni teoría literaria, ni filosofía de la literatura) y constituyen un esfuerzo por crear un espacio extraño en el cual sea posible desplegar y explorar temáticas que afectan un campo de problemas común. Por supuesto, este tipo de intervención halla su sentido en un contexto epocal en el cual el estatuto mismo del lenguaje está en el centro de todos los debates de las ciencias, tanto humanas y sociales como exactas y naturales. En efecto, es durante el siglo XX cuando se hace ineludible concentrar la mayor parte de los esfuerzos teóricos en la elucidación de las complejas relaciones entre el lenguaje, el pensamiento y el sujeto. Habida cuenta de que la abigarrada y heterogénea escena que esta situación dispone puede ser abordada desde diversos ángulos, elegimos aquí pensarla a partir de una de las preocupaciones que Maurice Blanchot hizo suya: las diferentes figuras bajo las cuales se ha pensado a la literatura en términos de representación (posible o imposible) del mundo. Ello implicará, en el caso del escritor francés, considerar la relación de la literatura tanto con el mundo ‘exterior’ (lo que habitualmente se refiere como ‘realidad’), como con el mundo ‘interior’ de las subjetividades que se conectan con ella (las figuras del escritor y el lector). Precisamente, es desde la perspectiva de la representación que ambas dimensiones (‘exterior’ e ‘interior’) encuentran un lugar común a partir del cual sería posible, en principio, interrogarlas: se trata de lo implicado por la noción de “símbolo”, tan frecuente en la teoría literaria como, más ampliamente, en el ámbito de las ciencias humanas en general. En este escrito, pondremos a prueba una hipótesis de lectura del meticuloso análisis sobre estos temas que Blanchot despliega en Le livre à venir (LV), una hipótesis que identifica en la utilización blanchotiana de la noción de símbolo un medio para llevar adelante una crítica radical de los restos de ‘idealismo’ que persisten en los postulados acerca de lo humano de ciertas teorías en vigencia en el ámbito de las ciencias humanas.1 A tal fin, nos detendremos en [End Page 31] las páginas que Blanchot dedica a Jorge Luis Borges a fines de la década de 1950, donde el escritor francés se vale de ciertas meditaciones borgeanas sobre el infinito y el tiempo para ahondar en los problemas relativos a la espacialidad y la materialidad de lo existente. A través de este examen, además, daremos cuenta de la afinidad entre ambos pensadores en lo referido al lugar y valor ontológico de lo literario, valor que impide subordinar la literatura (en tanto género discursivo) a la filosofía, en la medida en que se socavan las bases que hacen de la primera la vocera de la imaginación ligada al error y de la segunda el portavoz de la Verdad. El error y la verdad En 1958, Maurice Blanchot publica en la Nouvelle Revue Française el artículo “L’infini et l’infini”,2 en el cual se refiere a Henri Michaux y Jorge Luis Borges. Posteriormente, algunos parágrafos de aquel texto serían publicados por separado en Le Livre à venir (1959) bajo el nombre “L’Infini littéraire: L’Aleph” (LV, 130–134).

He smokes his hookah, while he dreams Of gibbets, weeping tears he cannot smother. You know this dainty monster, too, seems--Hypocrite reader!--You!--My twin!--My brother!--Charles Baudelaire, Au Lecteur (trans. Roy Cambell) Boredom is dream bird that hatches egg of experience.--Walter Benjamin, Storyteller Mark Twain's well-known story, Notorious of Calaveras County unfolds as its framing narrator's recollection of a time when he finds himself cornered to by a tedious storyteller: and he would go to work bore me to with some of him as long as tedious as should be useless to me. If that was his design, he succeeded (589). Death by boredom, however, does not bring about end of narrator's life, in fact, our narrator ultimately manages to escape from his storyteller pass along entire exasperating reminiscence to us, readers of Twain's story. Readers have long recognized that Twain's presentation of a storyteller who is himself unaware of ridiculous nature of his story makes narrative result all more humorous, that Jumping Frog illustrates technique of calmly passing along story of someone being to by a story in order to transform boredom into humor. In this essay, I specific stages of this narrative process: What sort of is meant by phrase bored to death, what does reframing of original story do for readers of Twain's text? Toward an answer, I argue that Twain's portrayal of humor-by-way-of-boredom suggests Maurice Blanchot's phenomenological view of freedom-by-way-of-death. As jokes may comprise provocative object of Freud's investigation of unconscious, so might Twain's popular, seemingly simple tale help to illuminate subtle features of narrative theory. By reading Blanchot's essay, Literature Right to Death, alongside Twain's Jumping Frog, I trace phenomenological nature of story's humor as dialectically encounters its negative other. This humorous experience of negative, in turn, precipitates a death that stands between defines relationship of speaker listener, or writer reader. In short, this essay follows experiences of a reader of Twain's story who discovers implications of Blanchot's assertion that speech is a warning that is loose in world, that has suddenly appeared between me, as I speak, being I address (43). For these two writers, death--the object of jokes parody for as long as stories have been told--marks a narrative limit, end of one state of consciousness beginning of another. In How to Tell a Story, Twain distinguishes humorous American tale from both comic English story witty French story: humorous story depends for its effect upon manner of telling; comic story witty story upon matter (201). Specifically, while comic witty stories may feature a delighted storyteller with a clear punchline, the humorous story is told gravely; teller does his best to conceal fact that he even dimly suspects that there is anything funny about it (201). For such a story audience plays an active, central role: Very often, of course, rambling disjointed humorous story finishes with a nub, point, snapper, or whatever you like to call it. Then listener must be alert, for in many cases teller will divert attention from that by dropping in a carefully casual indifferent way, with pretence that he does not know is a nub (201-2). The Jumping Frog, with its story-within-a-story, foregrounds this concern for narrative agency alert, if captive audience.

La interpretación de cada filósofo de los poemas de Hölderlin ilumina a la vez el modo diverso de cada uno de comprender el Ser y la existencia de la verdad que conduce a él. Para el Heidegger posterior a Ser y Tiempo, Hölderlin es capaz de hacer poesía sobre la poesía, permitiendo al lector adentrarse al mundo del lenguaje propio del Dasein y develar así su ser. Para el filósofo alemán, el poeta —más aún que el filósofo— es el único verdaderamente capaz de notar la dramática ausencia del misterio del Sein entre los mortales, y Hölderlin es el único poeta que intenta comunicar a los lectores aquella percepción. En cambio, para Blanchot, Hölderlin tiene la destreza de mostrar cómo el lenguaje encierra en sí su propia imposibilidad, pues intenta recoger el ser de aquello que deviene, y lo hace mediante la conceptualización. El poema, en cambio, no tiene para Blanchot la aspiración de conceptualizar, sino de volcarse a sí mismo. Esto queda expresado de manera paradigmática en Hölderlin.

Orpheus' search for reparation, beginning from the sense of an irreparable loss at the surface of things, echoes the human drama in a civilisation whose validating rituals have been drained of power. For Maurice Blanchot, the twentieth-century French literary theorist, novelist, and philosopher, myths can sometimes provide an allegorical starting point for thinking about the nature of literature. In Blanchot's extraordinary essay The Gaze of Orpheus Eurydice is the animate cadaver which Orpheus pursues by means of the self-surpassing magic of his song.

The article takes its starting point from a previous suggestion made by Michael Purcell that Blanchot's impossible relation may constitute a prolegemonon for a Christian doctrine of grace. Fundamental to this thesis is the philosophical journey of selfhood from Heidegger through Levinas to Blanchot. For Heidegger the self is constituted by death as the possibility of impossibility, whereas for Levinas and Blanchot the self is constituted by the impossibility of possibility. Consequently, for Levinas and Blanchot, the self, strictly speaking, as self-constituted, is impossible. Thus the self is due to excess, surplus, infinity – all suggestive, argues Purcell, of the gratuity of grace. However, a feature of distinction between Levinas and Blanchot is that the latter contains no sense of a Judeo-Christian concept of God. There is, for Blanchot, no opening out onto divinity and whatever excess constitutes the selfhood is correlated to something that is not divine in any traditional Christian sense. The paper argues that affliction and suffering serve to point to the dispossession of the self and open up to an experience of a ‘relation without relation to the outside’. In Blanchot's Death Sentence it becomes possible to see some features of how this dispossession of the self unfolds in the events between J. and the narrator.

Par Jean-François Hamel,Zoe Angelis,,2018,2018-10-15,French Studies,Liverpool University Press,article,en,False,"Jean-François Hamel’s book is neither a commemoration of the events of 1968 nor an exaltation of the role played throughout the upheavals by Maurice Blanchot (as a central figure within the Comité d’action étudiants-écrivains). The book, drawing on the interaction between politics and literature, explores the politics of literature. Its strength lies in the way it unveils the continuing significance of May ’68 inasmuch as it brings about ‘une révolution de la révolution’ (in Blanchot’s insightful formulation). In parallel, tracing affinities between Blanchot’s texts and some fundamental concerns of young Marx, Benjamin, Herbert Marcuse, Henri Lefebvre, and, of course, Dionys Mascolo (as the notes of the Blanchot archive at Harvard attest), Hamel makes a strong case for Blanchot as a radical political thinker. In this respect, not only will the book be an invaluable resource to a circle of devoted Blanchotians or to those engaged in the legacy of May ’68, but it will also be of interest to those working on political theory, intellectual history, and contemporary French thought. In ten brief chapters, the itinerary of the Comité d’action étudiants-écrivains, in its short period of existence, is skilfully and meticulously narrated. The Comité joins and defends the anti-authoritarian, anti-capitalist, and anti-imperialist call as put forth by the protesters, since its founding members, following a process of dis-identification and dispossession, recognize themselves in, and identify with, what was dismissed and segregated by the authorities as ‘la pègre’. At the same time, Hamel draws attention to the way in which, through the slogans, mural inscriptions, and leaflets of the Comité, an oppositional public space emerges in which the production, circulation, and control of discourse is contested. Enacting the Blanchotian conception of a ‘communisme d’écriture’, the members of the Comité engender a practice of anti-authoritative, anti-authorial (unsigned, collective), and fragmentary writing that echoes the oppositional force, and disperses itself into the anonymity, of the masses. More crucially, Hamel demonstrates how Blanchot’s space of literature merges into the open space of politics, namely how the metaphysical romanticism of L’Espace littéraire (1955, defending the autonomy of writing and the solitude of the writer) turns into a revolutionary romanticism. Affirming a turning point in Blanchot’s thinking and political initiatives throughout the 1960s (his opposition to Gaullism; his alliance with the Algerian people), Hamel shows how the Blanchotian key terms of ‘désœuvrement’ and ‘l’anonymat’ (which render the experience of the writer an unfoundational moment of profound refusal) become politicized and are thereby also encountered (and sustained) in the experience of protesters. For, as Hamel elucidates, the 1968 riots, reversing a long-established revolutionary tradition, do not aspire to institute a new order but, in their absolute immanence, act as a pure contestation, an irreconcilable negativity, an intense rupture (of time, history, power, and the law) that outsteps dialectical synthesis. The epigraph to Hamel’s book, a fragment of Blanchot’s La Communauté inavouable (1983), condenses the contemporaneity of 1968, its success and failure as well as the key importance of Blanchot’s thinking: ‘On se sépara par la même nécessité qui avait rassemblé l’innombrable.’",Action (physics) | Art | Art history | Authoritarianism | Democracy | Humanities | Law | Philosophy | Physics | Political radicalism | Political science | Politics | Quantum mechanics,https://openalex.org/W2901581295,1.0,,"Crossref, OpenAlex",12

At home, Rolland had been a bête noire of the nationalist right since his pacifist declarations during the First World War. A major adversary was Henri Massis. For Massis, as for Catholic nationalists more generally, French civilisation was the foundation of the Western world, which is to say, of humanity itself. In their eyes, Asia and its representatives (Gandhi, Tagore) were the agents of an assault on the West, which had been fatally weakened by what he called the “historical break” of 1917. Beginning with a close reading of Massis’s Defence of the West (1927), this study argues that the perceived threat of Asia in the 1920s, typified both politically and spiritually by the figure of Gandhi, was exclusively an issue for the Western mind. While appearing to adopt a historical and geopolitical perspective, Massis’s book is entirely in thrall to phantasmatic vision. The “historic break” it refers to lies first and foremost within the idea of the West and the Catholic notion of the person that provides its subject. The study moves on to contrast the total absence of Massis’s phantasmatic fears in the generation of young Catholic nationalists for whom he becomes a friend and mentor. In various ways, Gandhi is taken seriously by them and respected. Tracing the developing response to Gandhi in the writing of one of them — Maurice Blanchot — the study seeks to show how the mysticism without Christianity which Blanchot initially attributes to Gandhi evolves, between 1931 and 1944, into a mysticism without mysticism which becomes the basis for Blanchot’s narratives. These establish themselves at the very heart of the phantasmatic processes which produce the grand narrative of Western decline, and by harnessing them in language, effect a dispiriting of the mind which breaks with the Western idea entirely.",Adversary | Christianity | Civilization | Computer science | History | Humanity | Law | Library science | Mathematics | Mysticism | Nationalism | Philosophy | Political science | Politics | Religious studies | Sociology | Statistics | Subject (documents) | Theology,https://openalex.org/W2039394887,0.0,,OpenAlex,12

Em sua alegoria, o teórico retoma o episódio de Homero em que Ulisses ouve o canto dos seres sobrenaturais e sobrevive. Todo escritor, para Blanchot, repetiria o feito do personagem homérico, uma vez que, no ato de criação, ele seria movido por uma força que não compreende, uma força que move a literatura. Essa força recebe a denominação, dentre outras, de fala errante. Segundo Blanchot, essa fala duelaria com a razão e as normas que o escritor conhece. Desse embate nasce a literatura, como fruto de uma região fronteiriça, como algo que está sempre aquém e apontando sempre para além.

,"與他者之臉的倫理邂逅:勞倫斯小說中的語言,愛與性差異",張碧蓉 | Pi-jung Chang,,2004,2004-01-01,臺灣師範大學英語學系學位論文,,article,en,,"This study is an ethical reading of D. H. Lawrence’s fiction in the light of some thinkers—with more emphasis on Emmanuel Levinas, and also with reference to Jacque Derrida, Fredrick Nietzsche, Michel Foucault, Maurice Blanchot, and some French feminists— who have contributed to a re-thinking of ethical questions by focusing on our relation to an unsubsumable Other which is beyond the economy of the Same. Levinas’s concept of “absolute alterity” especially serves to inspire a re-vision of Lawrence’s repeated emphasis on “untranslatable otherness” in his work—a notion made more popular by poststructuralist theory. Levinas designates the ethical relation to the other as a face-to-face encounter, in which the self and the other do not exchange reciprocally because the face of the other manifests itself as a singular and irreducible gift. But a decisive question has been raised by Derrida in his engagement with Levinas—i.e., how can the other appear and be cared for in a face-to-face encounter? Against the background of the dialogue between Levinas, Derrida, and other thinkers, this dissertation examines three issues in Lawrence’s fiction—i.e., language, love, and sexual difference—which are profoundly relevant to Lawrence’s rejection of reducing the other to the Same, and hence might be explored to show the latent dangers as well as the ethical force in treating the other as absolutely different.
 In Part One, the attempt is to investigate the vital contribution Lawrence can make to our rethinking of ethical questions in terms of language, by referring to the premise of the recent ethical turn of deconstruction that the ethical function of language is confirmed, rather than dissimulated, by the undecidability of reference. Focusing on the linguistic complexities in Lawrence’s fiction, I’ll argue that Lawrence’s fiction seeks not only to offer an ethics of fiction, but to expose the fictional nature of ethics through otherness in language, with the referential and self-referential power of literary text existing in a dynamic and creative relationship. Part Two traces Lawrence’s attempt to seek for new ways to speak about love by comparing his conception of love with that of Levinas. Love is for them the ethical relation to alterity because it avoids the fusion of the Other with the Same. Lawrence’s formulation of “star-equilibrium” refers to the kind of love based on recognition and respect of intrinsic otherness. Yet, given that to have an ethical relation to absolute alterity is itself paradoxical, I’ll show that Lawrence treats the articulation of “star-equilibrium” not as an ideal structure of love but as a highly problematic possibility. Part Three looks into an ethics of sexual difference in Lawrence’s fiction by drawing upon the dialogue between Levinas and some feminist critics and by referring to the dialectic between ethics and politics proposed by some poststructuralist thinkers. I’ll maintain that, while Lawrence urgently insists on the incomparability between different sexed beings, sexual difference is for him not an unbridgeable gap, but a way to fertilize the distance and difference between sexes and the precondition for the pursuit of a world of justice.
 As the ethical reading provided by this study has revealed, Lawrence’s fiction is both a manifestation and a critique of the notion of absolute alterity. Therefore, this study is neither an application of a set of rules to Lawrence’s fiction, nor an occasional use of literature to prove a theory. In fact, Lawrence’s notion of “untranslatability” differs strikingly from postmodern conception of alterity. Lawrence surely does not belong to the vein of postmodern ethics because he never accords the other the priority as Levinas does—while Lawrence is chiefly concerned with how to flourish the self through an encounter with the truly other, Levinas is obsessed with how the self is infinitely obligated to respond to the call of the other. A reading of Lawrence’s fiction through an engagement with the thinkers of ethical alterity manifests that even the most secure ego cannot efface the other’s alterity when being faced with the other’s foreignness, even the most vulnerable and attentive ego is autonomous as a result when caring for the other, and even the most patient and non-violent reading cannot avoid reducing the literary text to a form of comprehension. For all that, their critique of violence in mental knowledge and self-consciousness and their rethinking of possibility and impossibility bring forth an ethical opening in intellectual culture and intersubjective relations, even though violence is inevitable and continues all along.",Alterity | Relation (database) | Face (sociological concept) | Philosophy | Reading (process) | Absolute (philosophy) | Epistemology | Psychoanalysis | Sociology | Aesthetics | Psychology | Linguistics | Database | Computer science,https://openalex.org/W2411151907,0.0,,OpenAlex,11

Merleau-Ponty and Blanchot thus, in inverting and reversing phenomenology, only repeat it by borrowing entirely from its metaphysical vocabulary and structure.

10.2979/antistud.3.1.07,,Bell,,2019,2019-01-01,Antisemitism Studies,,article,en,False,"Reviewed by: Is Theory Good for the Jews? French Thought and the Challenge of the New Antisemitism by Bruno Chaouat Dorian Bell Is Theory Good for the Jews? French Thought and the Challenge of the New Antisemitism. By Bruno Chaouat. Liverpool: Liverpool University Press, 2017. 224 pages. $120.00. (cloth). Tart and erudite, Bruno Chaouat's Is Theory Good for the Jews? takes a scalpel to an apparently gangrenous patient. The patient is what Chaouat groups under the heading of ""postmodern theory."" The gangrene is a Gallic Heideggerianism that set in with deconstruction, spread abroad, then rebounded back into France in a [End Page 146] postcolonial guise now blinding many—in Chaouat's telling—to the threat posed by a resurgent antisemitism. If not quite new, the diagnosis of an original Heideggerian sin gains in authority from the thickness of Chaouat's description. Readers familiar with French intellectual history will recognize here the continued fallout from decades-long scandals concerning various central thinkers in the history of deconstruction (Maurice Blanchot, Paul de Man, and, of course, Martin Heidegger himself) accused of youthful dalliances with fascism and antisemitism. Jeffrey Mehlman once located in Blanchot's postwar philosemitism a certain continuity with his pre-war antisemitic leanings. Chaouat generalizes the thesis, recounting postwar French thought's ""troping of the Jew"" into a paradigmatic figure of the anti-essentialist nomadism championed by leftist French philosophers from Gilles Deleuze to Jean-Luc Nancy (xiv). This troping echoes old antisemitic notions about Jewish deracination, even as it recodes and valorizes the diasporic existence for which Jews were once reviled as cosmopolitan threats to the nation. The resulting philosemitism, like any philosemitism, constitutes a possible Trojan horse, reminding us why Zygmunt Bauman subsumed under the term ""allosemitism"" the capacity of both antisemitism and philosemitism to problematically underscore Jewish difference. Chaouat's verdict falls along similar lines, and it is a stern one: postmodern theory's celebration of the exilic Jew denies real Jews the full range of agency, including sovereignty, to which political modernity entitles them. At their worst, French theory and its avatars have cleaved Jewishness into the supposedly ""authentic"" Jew—a figure of nomadic resistance to imperialist or nationalist essentialisms—and the comparatively ""bad"" Zionist attached to land and borders. Borrowing a coinage from Gabriel Noah Brahm, Chaouat argues that such ""Jew-splitting"" harks back to the Pauline conversion that reduced Jewishness to the false binary of revolutionary universalism and intransigent particularism. Supersession of the Jewish Paul by the apostle Paul meant dichotomizing away the very tension between chosenness and universal responsibility, kingdom and exile, at the heart of Jewishness itself. [End Page 147] The French thinkers whom Chaouat understands to have honored this tension fare best in his analysis. Emmanuel Levinas, Levinas' admirer Jacques Derrida, and Chaouat's own teacher, Jean-François Lyotard, all felt a responsibility to the complexities of the Jewish condition, complexities they mobilized to puncture the self-same Cartesian subject. To the extent, however, that the Jew became the figure par excellence of figuration, and thus of the subject's decentering by language's endlessly deferred meaning, the deconstructive turn also abstracted ""the Jew"" from anything resembling lived Jewish experience. And in less careful hands, Chaouat charges, deconstruction's romanticized Jew devolved into a return of the binarism deconstructive thought had set out to upend. Surveying a contemporary theoretical landscape fashioned by Giorgio Agamben, Judith Butler, Enzo Traverso, Alain Badiou, and others, Chaoaut traces the lurching footprints of a zombified Franco-Heideggerian ideal—the ""literary Jew"" of exalted, exilic victimhood (xix)—now used to distinguish good Jews from bad ones. What happened? Was a philosemitic theory ""doomed to drift into antisemitism"" from the start, as Chaouat provocatively asks (63)? Or can the patient be saved? Chaouat professes uncertainty on both counts. Recovering from his onetime zeal for a theory that now disappoints him, he nevertheless wonders whether the twenty-first century resurgence of antisemitism can be confronted ""without thinking theoretically"" (xxv, emphasis in original). So it is with the tools bequeathed to him by theory (though ultimately ones of a more psychoanalytic than deconstructive cast) that Chaouat sets about recuperating French thought from what ails it.

10.1353/sew.2013.0033,Prayerful Reading and Writing,Henry Hart,,2013,2013-01-01,The Sewanee review,,article,en,False,"Prayerful Reading and Writing Henry Hart (bio) Morning Knowledge by Kevin Hart (University of Notre Dame Press, 2011. 104 pages. $18 pb) Born in England, where his parents were so dismayed by his poor academic performance that they considered apprenticing him to a London butcher, Kevin Hart eventually moved to Australia, where he experienced a life-changing transformation, converted to Catholicism, and became one of the country's most distinguished scholars and poets. Discussing his new book of poems, Morning Knowledge, on Australia's abc Radio National, he acknowledges that most of his poems grow out of his Catholicism, especially its emphasis on prayer. ""In Catholicism,"" he says, ""prayer suffuses all of one's life by virtue of the sacraments. Prayer is not something that occurs [End Page xxvi] just on Sunday; it doesn't occur only at particular moments of intensity or by particular conventions; one's whole life is given up to prayer in many, many modes."" Hart then explains that he is drawn principally to the mystical and contemplative aspects of prayer: The mystical strain is the strain whereby the whole day can be given over to prayer through what we call lectio divina, prayerful reading of Scripture, through practice of meditation when one uses the imagination and the intellect with respect to images, and then, finally, and most difficult of all, contemplation, where one empties the mind of all images and all ideas, all concepts, in order to be completely attentive to God. What you find . . . in this mystical strain of Catholicism is that you're put in relationship with God, and you have many opportunities not only of talking with God in petitionary prayer, but also of listening to God, being attentive to God. Hart has traveled many roads to reach his complex understanding of mystical prayer. His mastery of philosophy, literary theory, theology, and poetry has made him a jack-of-all-trades. As Hart moved from continent to continent and department to department, he published a dozen scholarly books ranging in subject from Maurice Blanchot, Emmanuel Levinas, Jean-Luc Marion, and Jacques Derrida, to Samuel Johnson and A. D. Hope. He has also published nine books of poetry, establishing a reputation—in Harold Bloom's words—as ""the most outstanding Australian poet of his generation."" Hart's Morning Knowledge is an impressive addition to his ever-expanding oeuvre. He explores many subjects in his new book—the deaths of his parents, youthful romance, old Australian friends, domestic chores, flora and fauna in different parts of the world, his boyhood trip to the London butcher to get a job—but his poems repeatedly return to his religious concerns. One of two poems titled ""Prayer"" typifies his religious approach to experience. He begins by addressing his conception of a mystical God immanent in all beings, then recounts his paradoxical approach to God as a retreat into the past when he felt particularly close to the divine, ""When crumpled water showed its dark, wild life / And brooding morning shadows held me safe / And everything was overfull with us."" In the other poem titled ""Prayer"" he pleads for a return to a similar revelatory moment in the past when he felt unified with the natural world and its divine Creator. Thinking of a spring day in which dogwood flowers appeared as ""petal-prayer[s]"" and ""bee angels"" flew to them ""to smell / What prayer is,"" he ends his litany with a solicitation to God: ""Give me that month / And let it be the one great prayer I breathe / Without a word."" Like Gerard Manley Hopkins, a poet who has had an enduring influence on his poetry, Hart imagines Creation to be ""charged with the grandeur of God."" During certain visionary moments natural objects—trees and bees, [End Page xxvii] birds and flowers—""flame out"" in an expression of the Creator's awe-inspiring mystery. Hart's goal is to re-create and redeem those moments in his poems. Like many writers who have wanted to pay tribute to the sublimity of the Creator and Creation, Hart is caught in a dilemma. He realizes that his prayers and paeans are constructed of words that can only gesture—like...",Art | Contemplation | Economics | Finance | Intellect | Linguistics | Literature | Meditation | Mysticism | Order (exchange) | Philosophy | Poetry | Prayer | Reading (process) | Religious studies | Theology,https://openalex.org/W2006437205,1.0,,OpenAlex,11
10.1353/sli.2014.0001,The Monstrous Crossroads of Kristeva’s Textual Practice,Dawid Kołoszyc,,2014,2014-03-01,Studies in the literary imagination,,article,en,False,"The Monstrous Crossroads of Kristeva's Textual Practice Dawid Kołoszyc (bio) ""I am a monster of the crossroads,"" declares Julia Kristeva on more than one occasion in her work,1 referring not only to the complex intersections of her theoretical work, but also to her heterogeneous identity: a Bulgarian-born French linguist, literary theorist, psychoanalyst, cultural critic, and female intellectual determined to bring women's experience to structuralist and poststructuralist theories dominating the (mostly male) Parisian intellectual scene of the 1960s and '70s. Indeed, experience is the guiding post of Kristeva's thought, and her own experience as scholar, critic, and analyst has played a significant role in transforming the way we think about ""feminine"" writing, body, and desire. The aim of this paper is to explore Kristeva's contributions to the theory of the text, particularly in relation to textual practices of two contemporaries, Maurice Blanchot and Jacques Derrida, both of whom have played an integral role in transforming critical responses to literary writing since the 1960s. I will attempt to indicate a few significant points of convergence in their work in order to make Kristeva's concerns resonate more fully within a broader intellectual conversation, and to emphasize what she considers to be the limits of cotemporary literary theory. To be sure, no simple assertion can be made concerning the exact relationship between the immensely complex writings of these three authors. On the one hand, their approaches to reading and writing run parallel to one another, often sharing common terminology: text, difference, alterity, or otherness. Indeed, their central organizing motifs—for instance, Blanchot's ""worklessness"" and ""the neuter,"" Derrida's ""différance"" and ""dissemination,"" or Kristeva's ""negativity"" and ""productivity""—remain on very intimate terms with one another insofar as all three evoke that which is unthinkable, unknowable, or unspeakable, but without which no language or logic would be possible. On the other hand, each author's work develops a singular language that can never be entirely translated into another, even when it constantly affirms the necessity of precisely such translation. Their textual practices, to borrow Juliana de Nooy's formulation, mark ""the site of rupture-at-a-point-of-absolute-proximity"" (201). [End Page 1] Generally speaking, Kristeva's textual practice may be regarded as an attempt to negotiate between Blanchot's exploration of reading/writing as a descent into the silent, bottomless abyss of the text, and Derrida's reading/writing as an endless movement across the textual surface through deferral, dissemination, iterability, and supplementarity. Kristeva accomplishes this by placing emphasis on three problems which, in her view, have been somewhat marginalized in the theory of the text: (1) the relationship between textual practice and the experience of the human body, particularly with respect to questions of suffering and desire; (2) textual practice as political-social engagement, whereby questions of exile, solitude, or estrangement on the one hand, and the affirmation of play on the other, become explicitly linked to ethical concerns and their historical implementation; and (3) textual practice as the practice of intertextuality, in terms of both relationality and difference. In each case, Kristeva's intention is to assume the experience of the crisis of meaning that permeates the works of Blanchot and of Derrida, albeit in a manner that would, beyond the necessary intensification of this crisis at the intersection of sense and nonsense, enable both an individual and a cultural response to it—first and foremost at the level of language. By the same token, her textual practice is a deliberate attempt to negotiate between the kind of anonymity or neutrality Blanchot tends to emphasize in his work and Derrida's attempt to bring the radical dispersal of différance to every text, discourse, and meaning. The Text as Productivity Kristeva's complex and highly technical theory of the text was charted out in a series of essays written between 1966 and 1973; many of them were originally published in Tel Quel, and some remain untranslated today. The motifs explored in these writings were later elaborated in Kristeva's doctoral thesis, which was published in 1974 under the title La révolution du langage poétique: l'avant...",Aesthetics | Alterity | Art | Assertion | Computer science | Conversation | Economics | Epistemology | Finance | Identity (music) | Linguistics | Literature | Monster | Order (exchange) | Philosophy | Programming language | Psychoanalysis | Psychology | Sociology,https://openalex.org/W2216018530,3.0,,OpenAlex,11

Hillis Miller,Ning Wang,,2013,2013-12-01,Comparative Literature Studies,,article,en,False,"Reading Theory Now: An ABC of Good Reading with J. Hillis Miller is a unique book. The author has grasped the essentials of J. Hillis Miller's theoretical doctrine, critical thinking, and reading strategy. As Miller says in his preface, “Éamonn Dunne has understood my writings extremely well, almost too well for comfort. This wonderfully witty, subtle, and perceptive little book is the best introduction I know to my work” (3). I do not think that Miller is merely flattering Dunne, although Miller has always been kind to scholars of the younger generation. As Miller sums up, the book has four features: the acute, the arbitrary, comparison and contrast, and diversion (3–9). I quite agree with him, although I will add something more in this review. Also, as Miller points out, the book is “full of such ironic plays on words”: for example, the innocent word glossary turns into the more threatening “critico-glossolalia” (4). Dunne's research areas include speech act theory, narratology, contemporary Continental philosophy, and twentieth-century movements in literary theory and criticism, which follows closely what Miller has been doing since he started his academic career decades ago. Miller has so far published some thirty books and hundreds of articles or essays, with many of them translated into quite a few languages. Readers badly need such a book to guide them to have a good reading and correct understanding of Miller's works. In this sense, Reading Theory Now has been published at just the right moment.I have always found reading Miller's works to be a great pleasure, not only because he often gives insightful ideas for you to understand canonical literary works and contemporary cultural phenomena as well as the most cutting-edge theoretical trends, but also because he writes in a very eloquent and fluent style. Dunne also writes his book in a Millerian style. As the book description tells us, it “enables its readers to see how and why theoretical models of reading are of use only in the practical event of reading literary and philosophical texts, that the politics and poetics of interpretive paradigms are constantly shifting, changing and evolving as present day perspectives transform those traditions unalterably.” Indeed, Miller's works cover a wide range of disciplines and many branches of learning, which finds particular embodiment in his thirty or so books dealing with almost all the important Western writers or theorists: from such canonical writers as Jonathan Swift, Charles Dickens, George Elliot, Thomas Hardy, Joseph Conrad, Marcel Proust, D. H. Lawrence, Ernest Hemingway, and Wallace Stevens to some contemporary postmodern and postcolonial writers; from such eminent Continental philosophers as Immanuel Kant, Friedrich Nietzsche, Sigmund Freud, Edmund Husserl, Martin Heidegger, Jacques Derrida, Jean-Luc Nancy, Maurice Blanchot, Geoffrey Bennington, J. L. Austin, and Derek Attridge to his American colleagues such as M. H. Abrams and Paul de Man. As a former student of physics, Miller pays particularly keen attention to advanced technological innovations and even deals with their impact on literature and critical theory in his writings. That is why he always writes in a border-crossing and interdisciplinary way.As a Chinese scholar and reader, I have had personal interactions with Miller since I became acquainted with him in the beginning of the 1990s. Whenever I get hold of a book by him, I always feel great joy in reading it. But Miller's books are too many for me to collect or read. Sometimes, I also advise my students to read his books if they want to enhance their reading ability. But even so, I am perhaps one of the very few Chinese readers who have read most of his books and articles and am definitely most indebted to him personally, as well as to his writings. I have even supervised a Ph.D. student of mine who told me that she would write exclusively on Miller's critical theory for her dissertation, as she found his works truly fascinating. Apart from his writing, Miller is also a marvelous speaker, speaking at almost all the international conferences I have organized in China since the beginning of the century. Undoubtedly, he is the American literary scholar and theorist, together with Fredric Jameson, who is most familiar to Chinese literary scholarship and who has had the greatest influence on contemporary Chinese literary theory and criticism.When I started to read Dunne's book, I had no difficulty finding that the author has similar ideas. What particularly impressed me is that writing in a Millerian style, Dunne tries to put Miller's books in alphabetical order, with each letter representing either one of his books or an important concept. It is both interesting and arbitrary but makes it difficult for me to introduce one chapter after another. The twenty-six letters of the English alphabet exactly cover Miller's twenty-six published books. So the publication of this book undoubtedly serves as the best guide both to enable those who are already familiar with Miller's works to have a systematic and deeper understanding of his entire works and to encourage those who are just interested in Miller's works to read more of his books. It is worthy of being called the “ABC” of reading Miller's works, as well as the ABC's or essentials of his works proper.Unlike many of his fellow literary scholars, Miller is particularly keen on Theory, a concept that takes us far beyond literary theory. He always writes between literary and cultural theories, between literary and cultural critical studies. He is also a theorist, not the one always sticking to the abstract deduction of metaphysical theory but, rather, one especially good at applying various theoretical doctrines, chiefly Derrida's deconstructive theory combined with Poulet's phenomenological theoretical doctrine, to the practical reading of both literary and theoretical works. So in this sense, this book is no doubt worthy of being called “reading theory.”Since Miller has published extensively, how to read his works and grasp his major achievements? This is what Dunne tries to tell us. Although the main title of the book is Reading Theory Now, it does not merely stick to theory in a monologic way. It is written in a dialogic way, not just between the author and Miller but among three people, since the book has a wonderful afterword by Julian Wolfreys, which “tackles these issues in Miller's latest books.” When we read the book, we cannot help feeling as if we are, together with the author and the commentator, having dialogues with Miller. So its full title is appropriate: Reading Theory Now: An ABC of Good Reading with J. Hillis Miller.As we know, Miller is extremely good at reading, reading not only literary works but also theoretical works. To him, “each reading is a putting into question of the theoretical apparatuses that Miller himself has brought with him to those texts” (155). If we say that Derrida was a very meticulous reader, whom nothing could escape as a reader, then Miller has really mastered the technique of reading in a deconstructive way. For him, “understanding good reading … is to understand that each reading is in its own way inaugural, disruptive, unforeseeable. Reading in this way causes us to understand that there is no single theory capable of predicting what will happen when a given text is read at a given time” (155).Miller's deep attainment in theory finds embodiment in his three books published in 1990 and 1991. In Theory Now and Then we read essays on the phenomenological criticisms of the Geneva school and Georges Poulet, as well as on deconstruction and pedagogy; possibly Miller's most famous single essay, “The Critic as Host,” as well as essays on de Man, Nietzsche, and Stevens; and the presidential address for the 1986 Modern Language Association conference, “The Triumph of Theory, the Resistance to Reading, and the Question of the Material Base.” Even in dealing with theoretical issues, Miller never forgets to find literary elements in theoretical works. So for Miller, reading theory is no doubt a pleasure rather than a heavy burden.On Literature is nothing short of a passionate defense of literature's continuing influence on our lives and a wonderful exemplification of the intense pleasure Miller derives from reading literary works. Dunne holds that the book might be described as a miniscule “open sesame” into the workings of Miller's own particular concerns with reading literature and theory (167). In this book, Miller advocates a sort of “good reading”: slow, close, critical attention to detail. With this method of reading, one can certainly enjoy the aesthetic pleasure of literature (167): “Reading theory in this way alerts us to the way that theoretical texts themselves must be read as scrupulously and rhetorically as literary texts. If we are responsive to or responsible in our readings we will come to see that theory is not the end of reading, but its beginning” (23).For Derrida originally aimed to pay tribute to Miller's long-standing friend Jacques Derrida. Dunne tries to argue that, however paradoxically, the only way to talk sensibly about Derrida is to “avoid generalizing about these key terms, to dispense with the hearsay and the cant, and to go back to the texts themselves, something Miller has been doing consistently since 1965 in the original French” (171).Readers may well agree that Miller is a superb reader and interpreter of both literary and theoretical works who expresses his ideas in a fluent and elegant style. Perhaps this is why he could be more welcome among the broad reading public both in the West and elsewhere. But unfortunately, Reading Theory Now does not elaborate this aspect further. Another point I want to mention is this: as we know, Miller is a very productive author, whose recent articles and essays express his worry about the future of literature in the age of globalization under the regime of telecommunication technologies. As for this, Reading Theory Now only focuses on his books rather than on those miscellaneous articles and essays published in journals. As Dunne admits, “Any list-like rendering of recurring topics in J. Hillis Miller's work is bound by that very procedure to be exclusive and somewhat arbitrary” (12). To the author, “Reading Theory Now is likewise a title that comes to me as a necessity, a strategy and an adventure” (19). So Dunne warns readers that if they want to have a deep understanding of Miller's works, it is “not enough to read Miller reading. You have to go back to the texts themselves” (28).In any event, the publication of Dunne's book has filled a gap in Miller studies in a comprehensive way. It responds to the pessimistic ideas that theory is dead and that literature is dead. But after reading this book, we cannot help feeling that literature is not dead at all. Nor is theory, which functions effectively in interpreting various literary and critical works. It has full reason to have the title Reading Theory “Now,” when theory is said to be no longer so fascinating as it used to be. But theory will still help us to have a more profound understanding of literary works and of various cultural phenomena in this age of globalization. This is the great value of this small but forceful book.",Art | Biology | Criticism | Ecology | Epistemology | Linguistics | Literature | Miller | Philosophy | Reading (process),https://openalex.org/W4255202709,0.0,,OpenAlex,11
10.1215/08879982-4253064,The Scholar as Poet: Remembering Geoffrey Hartman (1929–2016),Morris Dickstein,,2017,2017-01-01,Tikkun,,article,en,False,"GEOFFREY HARTMAN, who died in March 2016, was known as one of the most eminent literary scholars of the past half century, going back to his book based on his doctoral thesis, The Unmediated Vision (1954). His book on William Wordsworth, published ten years later, remains a standard work, perhaps the single most searching study of Wordsworth’s poetry to appear in the twentieth century. He subsequently became a leading figure in the turn toward literary theory beginning with the essays collected in Beyond Formalism (1970) and The Fate of Reading (1975), as well as a general study, Criticism in the Wilderness (1980). In the 1980s his work took yet another direction: towards Jewish issues, including biblical and Midrashic interpretation, as well as the conditions for understanding and assimilation of the Holocaust. Along with his wife Renee, a Holocaust survivor, he was instrumental in the founding of the Yale Video Archive for Holocaust Testimonies, which paved the way for the much larger archive of oral recollections created by Steven Spielberg after the worldwide success of Schindler’s List.I met Geoffrey Hartman some fifty-five years ago when I was a fledgling graduate student, quite miserable, and he was on the verge of leaving Yale, having been unaccountably turned down for tenure. I looked him up in one of the college’s remote basement offices after reading an essay he wrote for the Chicago Review on Maurice Blanchot, a mesmerizing European critic altogether unknown to me. Soon afterward I ambled down York Street to the offices of Yale University Press, where I bought one of the few remaining copies of his first book, The Unmediated Vision, still available at its original price of four dollars. I never studied with him, but we formed a bond rooted perhaps in mutual unhappiness along with an instinctive sense of intellectual kinship. In the Yale of 1961, a gentleman’s university still dominated by complacent academic and social routines, we both felt like outsiders.Undoubtedly, there were also shared Jewish feelings neither of us mentioned. He became an informal mentor to me — in both the new currents of literary theory wafting over from Europe and the nascent revival of interest in Romanticism that had already attracted me as an undergraduate at Columbia. Geoffrey was working on his Wordsworth book, which would come to make his reputation. It would mark a signal turn in the new Romantic scholarship, transforming Wordsworth from a decorous nature poet and Victorian icon into a probing, dark modern poet of consciousness. Soon after the book came out I began to work on a thesis on Keats, far more modest but along the same lines.But Geoffrey was far more than an admired and fitfully emulated scholar for me. I loved his genuine warmth, his sparkling and urbane intelligence and wit, his cosmopolitan range of interests. He was a living heir of the émigré comparatists and philologists like Erich Auerbach and René Wellek who had been his teachers at Yale. Ideas and texts had an almost visceral reality for him; his exhaustive scholarship was part of the air he breathed. This might help explain his brief romance with deconstruction — the sheer ingenuity of Derrida or de Man must have proved irresistible for him. When his own essays turned knotty, dense with learned puns and allusions, it was because he loved being playful and challenging. The plain style, he once told me, held little interest for him, though he mastered it effectively. The Hebraic side of his later work and his unexpected engagement with issues of Holocaust memory and representation spoke more directly to me. In helping to create a pioneering archive of oral witness, he became a public person, an actor as well as a thinker. But above all else I’ll always recall and cherish the sweetness of his personality, along with his scrupulous attentiveness and insight as a reader and essayist. He served as a beacon and role model for many former students, just as he did for me.That Hartman had also written and published poetry was not so widely known — though a small volume, Akiba’s Children, appeared in 1978. In 2013, he published The Eighth Day: Poems Old & New, which includes selections from that book along with later work. The differences in style between the older and newer poems make it seem like two books in one. The poems from Akiba’s Children are intensely worked, almost impacted with terse and constantly shifting linguistic detail, but also at times gnomic, even opaque. Hartman’s criticism is celebrated for its close readings of poetic language and has been at times poetic itself in its compression and density. This is true of these early poems, which belong to the latter end of a phase of high modernism which aimed for a maximum of compression and allusiveness, sometimes by deploying a fragmentary discontinuity in the manner of Eliot’s Waste Land. This kind of writing was promoted by the New Critics and welcomed in the classroom. Here not simply intensity but difficulty itself was seen as a mark of authenticity, an exorcism of the prosaic and the extraneous. In exactly this vein, note, for example, the telescoping of the opening lines of Hartman’s “Mariner’s Song”:After he had maimed the dragon deepand throned us in new limbs of everlastingopening to fable the mortal starswe wept praises and harped the flood of his word.It’s hard to know what to make of phrases like “harped the flood of his word” or enjambments like “new limbs of everlasting/opening to fable the mortal stars.” The poem seems to be referring suggestively to a known myth yet the actual allusion remains out of reach, to me at least. The language is at once rich and subtly deformed, at least by any prose standard. In another early poem, “The Middle of the Garden,” the thing not named, clearly, is Adam and Eve, but even if we catch the allusion it scarcely makes the poem more accessible. The best of these poems are those with an overt biblical subject and/or a clear narrative thread, such as “Abraham,” “Passage to Ithaca,” “The Silence,” “Ahasuerus,” “In Honor of the Master of the Good Name,” and especially “The Reporter.” This last poem is a fine biblical meditation of the passage in the Book of Samuel in which the Holy Arc is captured in battle by the Philistines. The poem has sweep, clarity, and fine continuity. But in many other poems from this part of the book, there is instead an overall sense of dark mystery; the poems seem to have been conceived as enigmas, encoded challenges to the reader to experience them as language and feeling without fully understanding them.Matters are very different in the later sections of the book. Here, in line with more recent trends in American poetry, the verse forms are more free and irregular; the language is marked by an almost colloquial and conversational flow, as in “Day of Remembrance,” a Passover poem but also a Holocaust poem, which begins: “This is the flat bread/nothing rises/ this is the time/ nothing can rise.” Later he writes: “In the ovens/ overt/ the loaves are/ flat corpses:/ unpardonably/ only nightmares lurk,/ words like a tired bell,/ a maimed and graying sun.” At this seder “Elijah’s cup/ stands untouched./ Through the door echoes fly/ and unreadable ash.” The remembrance of liberation, the very matzoh itself, as turned to flattened corpse and ash. Here, he concludes, “We break bread with each other/ in the bitter dawn of night,” a scene of both dark and light.Another late poem, “Elegy at the Bodensee,” not only has a narrative shape and flow but seems based on a real experience, not simply meditation and allusion. These poems are less like riddles, more like diaristic notations recording both intimate feelings and external happenings. “Psalm,” for example, though its title points to a biblical antecedent, reads like personal poem with a real rather than a narrative “I;” a self wholly present though elusive: “My soul, who has anointed you,/ are you still thirsty like the east winds,/ or sated, ready to be poured out?/ Whose dark dew floods you and I do not know it?” This is an interior language reminiscent of the Psalms, but also an accessible voice. A poem like “Passing By,” about the descent from the cross, has a clear narrative spine, as if it were a recollection of an actual experience. It is reader-friendly in a quiet, unassuming way. “I saw them take a man down from the cross,” it begins, and it proceeds to take the point of view of a witness, a mere passer-by, who, without knowing what he is taking in, provides us with descriptive details, such as the lowering a body that feels like “dead weight,” the sight of inserting it awkwardly in a shroud while others are simply looking on, murmuring or weeping.I was curious to know what crime the corpsehad committed, but no one seemed to careabout the bearded, not unbeautiful face,except to dispatch the dead in good order,to lay the body carefully from sightwith lavings, myrrh, and linen grave-clothes:so I too committed his face to the earth.The strength of these later poems can be seen in “The Memory of Paul Celan,” a tribute to the German poet whose spirit presides over some of these works. It is a jagged poem, like so many of Celan’s own, with a rhythm that reflects the experience of rupture and dissonance, the very difficulty or writing, the challenge of finding language to express almost unspeakable memories and experiences.Somewhere in Kadesh, color of shard and sound,pen’s mouth stopped up, my fingers broken teeth,I who feed on memories rotting like mannastrangle words near his darkened breast.Hartman’s poems represent a lesser known, more personal side of his work. They show him wrestling with Judaism and the Bible in ways that surfaced only much later in his critical prose. Hartman never claimed to be anything more than a Sunday poet but he was able to express things in verse — misgivings, meditations, evocations of moments in Jewish texts and the Jewish calendar — that he could not find expression in his critical writings. “Yoma” was his last poem — it’s deeply wrenching lines written during his final illness, grappling with it in terms that link the anguish of the Psalms with moods and images from Gerard Manley Hopkins’s so-called “terrible sonnets,” poems of spiritual crisis, but also Eliot’s Waste Land, with its evocation of a dry season of the soul. The poem’s title “Yoma,” is the tractate of the Talmud that deals with the preparations for Yom Kippur, the Day of Repentance and Judgment. Projecting a heart-rending sense of uncertainty, desperation, and contrition, it raises an ultimate but unanswerable question, “Where is comfort to be found?”",Art | History | Literature | Psychoanalysis | Psychology,https://openalex.org/W2773086817,0.0,,OpenAlex,11

But though the history of Blanchot's political involvements is now quite well documented (albeit frequently misrepresented to polemical ends), much remains to be understood about Blanchot's conception of the political. Prompted in part by his support for the ‘Not In Our Name’ appeal, which was to be one of Blanchot's last political gestures, this essay fragment, which is part of a longer inquiry, reconstructs the writer's thinking on the question of the subject of politics and the closely related issue of the relationship between law and violence. It examines Blanchot's response to Hölderlin's translation of a famous fragment from Pindar entitled ‘Das Höchste’ (‘The Most High’) and places Blanchot's writing within the wider context of the political thought of Benjamin, Schmitt, Agamben, and Derrida.",Appeal | Archaeology | Art | Computer science | Context (archaeology) | Fragment (logic) | History | Law | Library science | Literature | Philosophy | Political science | Politics | Programming language | Subject (documents),https://openalex.org/W2101988054,4.0,,"Crossref, OpenAlex",11

Reading Jacques Derrida's deconstruction of this econo-onto-thanatology, and relating him to Schelling, Heidegger, Levinas and Kierkegaard, this article attempts to reveal this very complex relationship of the ethical notion of responsibility and the gift with death, in order to think anew – in the spirit of Derrida – a responsibility in relation to mourning and abandonment, and in relation to a death that does not figure in any figuration of self-figuration and self-presence, but – to speak with Maurice Blanchot – as interminable, incessant worklessness, as endless ruination and abandonment of itself.

Re-reading Blanchot's text, I argue that it is on the borderlines of sleep that the ‘arrythmic pulsation’ of the arrêt de mort happens as impossible event – ‘the state of suspension in which it's over – and over again, and you'll never have done with that suspension itself’, to quote Derrida once more. While ‘Living On’ makes little of sleep, however, I take this cue to follow a pathway which leads from Blanchot to Levinas. Blanchot's writing exposes the sleep of reason which occurs in the very promise of perfect day, a promise which mutates in the dream he associates with the ‘other night’, a dream which harbours the irrepressible return of ‘time's absence’, and which opens on to the very ‘outside’ which the world – and the self – lacks or wants (as much as ‘world’ or ‘self’ seek to overcome this ‘outside’ as such). Levinas, meanwhile, wants to think irremissible pure existing (il y a) in terms of insomnia; in contrast, consciousness seeks to assert itself over the unremitting presence of the ‘there is’ through its capacity for unconsciousness or sleep. This essay seeks to attend to the complexities of a certain ‘fatality of being’ that threatens to sweep away the ‘ego’ as consciousness's capacity to sleep is confronted by the radical vigilance of insomnia and the deep anonymity of the night (Existence and Existents).",Art | Consciousness | Dream | Epistemology | Literature | Philosophy | Psychiatry | Psychoanalysis | Psychology | Psychotherapist | Unconsciousness,https://openalex.org/W2036979956,0.0,,"Crossref, OpenAlex",11

He introduced phenomenology to France through his translation of Husserl’s Cartesian Meditations into French, and he developed a lifelong friendship with Maurice Blanchot. Prior to the rise of Hitler and Nazi Germany, Levinas’s philosophical work focused on Husserlian phenomenology. His thought took a dramatic turn in the mid-1930s when he focused on the philosophical threat of Nazism. He spent 1940–1945 in a German POW camp. Returning to Paris after the war, he immediately went back to work for the Alliance Israélite Universelle (AIU), where he became director of the École Normale Israélite Orientale (Enio), the Jewish day school. He resumed working on his question from the 1930s—the philosophical problem of identity and transcendence—with an added urgency in the wake of World War II. From 1946 until his death in 1995, Levinas’s ethical project searched for a way to address this philosophical problem of escape, developing a view of the self as an ethical subject that allows one to transcend the self without leaving the body behind. From the 1940s to the early 1960s, he developed the first version of his ethical project. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, he responded to criticisms of that early work. Central to Levinas’s description of the ethical relationship are references to literary works including Dostoyevsky and Shakespeare. Although Levinas was an observant Jew, the biblical narratives, in addition to being part of a sacred text, also serve as rich sources of examples for the philosophical descriptions of the ethical relationship he develops. Levinas is not obviously identified with literary theory—not in the way that Derrida is, for example. He did become popular within literary theory circles in the 1990s and might be taught more frequently in comparative literature departments than in philosophy departments, especially in the United States. His friendship with both Blanchot and Derrida had a significant impact not only on their thinking but also those who whose work was influenced by them. References to terms like the other/Other, the trace, hospitality, ethics, and alterity found throughout Blanchot and Derrida, and now more commonly in literary theory, can be traced back to Levinas’s ethical project.",Epistemology | Existentialism | Friendship | German | Judaism | Law | Linguistics | Nazism | Phenomenology (philosophy) | Philosophy | Political science | Psychoanalysis | Psychology | Social science | Sociology | Theology | World War II,https://openalex.org/W4206631136,0.0,,OpenAlex,11
,Derrida and a Theory of Irony: Parabasis and Parataxis,Maebh Long,,2010,2010-01-01,,,dissertation,en,,"This thesis presents a theory of structural irony gleaned from the irony theorised and performed in the texts of thinkers whose works operate on the border of the (non)propositional: Plato, Friedrich Schlegel, Maurice Blanchot, Paul de Man, Emmanuel Levinas and Jacques Derrida. While focusing on the irony performed in the texts of Jacques Derrida, and using his engagements with these thinkers as a frame, this is not a theory of “Derridean” irony, but an irony (primarily) elaborated through a deconstructive approach and vocabulary. Structural irony is seen to take the form of the transgressive step/counter-step of parabasis and the non-hierarchical disorder of parataxis. It is an anacoluthic force/weakness, and exhibits the conjunctive/disjunctive trait of hyphenation. It is neither of cynical, aesthetic distance nor humorous, parodic engagement, but is a productive movement of (impossible) negotiation between terms. Irony is an expression of the beyond, within, and this reworking of borders and limits is performed in the fragment/aphorism. The (ir)responsible step taken in Derrida’s texts is understood as a mode of structural irony, and it is proposed that the stylistic changes that occurred in Derrida’s “later” texts were in part due to the autoimmunity caused by an overexposure to the “laws of the interview”. Throughout the thesis styles that manipulate the unmasterable excesses of irony are investigated, and each chapter ends with a reading of one of Derrida’s more “literary” or “performative” texts, while recognising and playing with the falsity of such generic makers or divisions. Inscribing Derrida within a tradition of thinkers of the non-thetic both extends readings of that tradition and of irony itself, while affording a valuable way of approaching the “structures” within Derrida’s texts. Irony is not presented as the transcendental signifier of deconstruction, but as a profitable way of understanding deconstruction and its relation to other writers.",Irony | Philosophy | Literature | Epistemology | Aesthetics | Linguistics | Art,https://openalex.org/W178750145,6.0,,OpenAlex,11

Just as ontology focuses on existence, meontology emphasizes nonexistence as an alternative that can supposedly be extrapolated in the study of literature. Also described as “apophatic” literary discourse, this potentially esoteric investigation of literary nothingness is perhaps best grasped as secular theology, a synthesis derivative of Blanchot, Levinas, Heidegger, Deleuze, and Derrida. As explained by Conor Cunningham and quoted by Mehtonen, “The ultimate nothing governs its logic. In contrast to ontotheology, questions are not asked by one final answer: the something. Rather, there is but one question asked an infinity of times by the nothing.” Cunningham continues: “It is argued that both traditions are nihilistic. But I suggest that the first leads to nihilism, while the latter is the realized logic of nihilism” (16).Perhaps the most basic assumption of the collection is that while absolute nothingness is finally inaccessible to consciousness, it can at least be evoked or somehow approximated in the realm of fiction. As Mehtonen indicates in the preface, “Negative terms and obscurity do not appear here as a means of endless suspicion of the limits of language but, on the contrary, as ways of seeing and making visible the forms and agendas (rhetorical, poetic) of literary expression” (7). This, it seems, is best illustrated by the vision of deprivation verging on extinction offered by such writers as Borges, Blanchot, Beckett, Kafka, and even, properly interpreted, such literary warhorses as Dante, Shakespeare, and Dryden.Just as all earlier critical approaches featured their own protocol nomenclatures, the literary application of meontology in Illuminating Darkness brings into play words and word combinations such as diegesis, gnomicity, alterity, exteriority, futurality, theologeme, agogic, and the wholly other (“der ganz Andere” [202]). Mehtonen also suggests a large potential Greek vocabulary of “alpha privatives” (10)—with the prefix a- indicating the absence of—in such words as agnoston (the unknown), arretos (the ineffable), anonomastos (without name), adianoeta (supposedly transparent but with hidden meaning), and adynaton (the impossibility of expression). As before, most notably with both New Criticism and psychoanalytic criticism, the task of the aspiring critics versed in meontology becomes a matter of absorbing this nomenclature well enough to put it to use in the interpretation of literature.As a concession to received assumptions, several authors are quoted who emphatically reject the possibility of total nothingness in human discourse on the assumption that as soon as nothing is declared it becomes something at least to that extent. For example, Sartre insists that “thinking that thinks that it doesn't know anymore is still thinking” (153). Bergson indicates, “Nothing is taken not to apply as a form of absence but rather of disappearance or substitution” (119). Even Maurice Blanchot declares, “Nothingness means…a privative relation to being, a negativity of being, a no-thing, and not an absent thing as being present” (170). And Mehtonen himself assures readers in note 5 of his introduction that “Instead of unrestricted negation I am interested in features of texts which are affirmed (become visible) through negation” (11). All of these assertions concede the final inaccessibility of absolute nothingness in the context of literary expression.Blanchot is also quoted, however, to suggest a viable compromise: “Literature is not nothing; or [it] is a step to nothing” (170). As the experience of nothing's imminence just before its full attainment, this preliminary aspect of obliteration does in fact become possible as a literary consideration, for example, with Hamlet's final line, “The rest is silence.” It is also possible to agree with the proposal of one of the included essayists, Leena Kaakinen, for a slightly different kind of nothingness based on the distinction between failed and successful actualizations—“Every actualization and definition is a negation, not in relation to actual being but in relation to the entirety of possibilities.…Reality is surrounded by a host of other possibilities. These show the limitedness and relativity of actualized reality and remind the reader that instead of this reality some other reality could have been actualized” (135). Here nothing consists of unrealized alternative options rather than total nullification. Most of us in fact take for granted what amounts to an infinitude of nonexistent possibilities at the edge of experience—all the potential events and behaviors that do not materialize—for example, the automobile accident that almost happens, the choice that gets rejected (most obviously a potential wife or husband), and everything else that verges on actualization without taking place.In “How to Avoid Doing Things with Words,” Outi Alanko-Kahiluoto brings meontology to bear on J. L. Austin's distinction between the constative and performative aspects of signification (telling and doing) by exploring one episode in Blanchot's novel Thomas l'obscur (1941), which evokes extreme deprivation short of death during confinement underground, as if in a grave. Based on this episode, Alanko-Kahiluoto draws upon Mark Taylor to suggest a third option to Austin's dichotomy—simply enough “the struggle to do nothing with words.” Here it seems obvious that doing nothing means doing something at least in the sense of avoiding something to be done. In the final analysis, according to Blanchot as explained by Alanko-Kahiluoto, “The task of literary language…is not to ask ‘how to do things with words' (which was Austin's question) but to ask ‘how to speak without saying anything,’ or how to do nothing with words” (165). But is the spoken void in this near-death episode truly nothing? Is it even penultimate to nothing? Moreover, who is it that supposedly does nothing with words? Is it the character, the story's narrator, or the author himself, whose intentions, after all, involved some kind of an audience and the possibility of marketing the story?Leena Kaakinen examines the themes of nothingness and absence in the Polish poet Szymborska in light of Heidegger's philosophy based on Meister Eckhart's assumption that God can be treated as nothing because his existence is inaccessible to human intellect. Szymborska's most suggestive poetry, she argues, features a “lacking and emptiness” at the core of its reality but such that the paradox cannot be ignored that “emptiness still refers to something. It is not only emptiness; it is not just nothing—it becomes full of meaning” (138). In her survey of early English encounters with the unknown, Maria Salenius also suggests Meister Eckhardt's null conception of God: “An important aspect of the framework of the medieval world-view as well as the concept of God was that of a surrounding obscurity, or nothingness” (48).In “Pan's Hour,” Sari Kivistö tackles what might seem an exception to prove the rule, “the midday expectancy” of divine encounters in nineteenth-century poetry, when the there is a “hushed sense of awe” and yearning for “the perception of the Absolute or Ideal,” only to be replaced by futile emptiness and the absence of spiritual forces. At this time, she explains, “the imagination depends on non-presence, and the void itself offers an occasion for positively charged divine epiphanies, poetical dreams, and beautiful visions” (102). Unfortunately, the wealth of pantheistic experience interpreted reminds us that the prefix pan- indicates “all,” exactly the opposite of nothing. True to this signification, Kivistö's piece comes off as a noble failure, though we can be grateful for the effort.Anders Olsson's piece, “Aphoristic Obscurity,” provides a useful discussion of nothingness relevant to aphorisms treated as a particular genre. Olson begins by paying lip service to the traits of discontinuity, brevity, and materiality, the latter involving obscurity as an “acute sense of interrupting or disturbing the reader's experience of the text” (84). Later he treats La Rochefoucauld's triad: gnomicity (a claim to general truths), brevity, and discontinuity. Still later he sympathizes with Blanchot's effort to avoid the orthodox dependence on closure and self-sufficiency in a “totality where contradictions are reconciled.” His own emphasis instead shifts to “writing by interruption,” as exemplified by the style of Montaigne, Swift, and Sterne, as well as the “elasticity” that integrates metaphor and irrational leaps of thought in Novalis. Olsson concludes with a brief presumably aphoristic poem by the Swedish writer Vilhelm Ekelund, in which resistance and discontinuity expressive of materiality predominate. He translates the poem in its entirety, which is short enough to reproduce here without its usual formatting: “a lonely a beyond / a soundless / your silence / an / dumbness / a lonely / and resembling /foot blade in the room / and like the sea / over earth and your step” (96). Whatever the value of this text as an epiphany or as poetry in its original language, it totally falls short of aphorism in my opinion, as much as anything because of excessive materiality. It would in fact be difficult to find a text more at odds with the subversive acuity of aphorisms than this particular passage. What is missing? Among other things I would suggest, (1) a sentential equation (A = B when x does y, etc.); (2) an imbedded paradox (X = not exactly X ); and (3) a quick and delicious sense of discovery (a nontragic version of anagnorisis) in recognizing the appropriateness of this paradox.In the next to last essay, Jari Kauppinen explores the influence of Blanchot on Derrida's “dialectics of difference without a solution” (171), thereby using Derrida's relatively late religious pronouncements to justify his own extension of apophatic explication into the fields of ethics and religion. Kauppinen is especially struck by Derrida's insistence “that there is a need for evil, an original possibility of evil before any distinction between darkness and light or good and evil” (175–76). The more basic question, according to Levinas, is whether ethics precedes ontology. Kauppinen also paraphrases Derrida to the effect that “the best is limited by the worst of the worst, the more radical evil than the radical evil ever imagined (satanic and absolute evil).…It must be arch-evil that limits the good, the best, and the ethical” (183). Here ethics seems to take precedence, but the Manichaean eschatology implicit in these pronouncements would seem to have little relevance to the concept of nothingness. If “radical evil” exists (which is arguable), it too often involves blatant excesses in the pursuit of supposedly virtuous goals—for example, the twisted righteousness of Torquemada, Hitler, Stalin, and so many others if on a smaller scale.The final essay by Pajari Räsänen turns to religion itself as the most inclusive perspective of sacred nothingness whereby, as explained by Derrida, “the name of God may also name my capability of ‘keeping a secret that is visible from the interior but not from the exterior,’ my ability to keep the invisible word (parole invisible)…[as] a witness that others can't see, and who is therefore other than me and more intimate with me than myself ” (203–4). Again, it is difficult to grasp the relevance of nothingness in this context, which seems rooted in issues of inner identity more accessible to psychoanalytic interpretation. Räsänen concedes that a poem can be “something not very different from a handshake” (201) but elsewhere expresses his confidence that, with practice, folded hands in prayer can also write at the same time—“like a prayer apostrophised” (187)—this despite Janus Pannonius's pronouncement in the fifteenth century that “no one is both religious and a poet.”Whether intended or not, a bait-and-switch strategy seems to occur in the sequence of essays. All about nothing is promised at the beginning in the fullest sense of the word, but religious considerations keep mounting until the final two essays focus on a wholly Christian vision of nothingness rooted in Derrida's “turn to religion” toward the end of his life. Moreover, literature itself becomes almost irrelevant in too much of the interpretation. With just a couple exceptions, contributors immersed in the concept of nothingness betray little genuine sympathy with literary achievement beyond a smattering of texts and passages that exemplify their theory, while contributors able to immerse themselves in literature, most notably Tina Skouen and Pekka Kuusisto, have little to say about the theory of nothingness.I suspect the best way to appreciate this collection's accomplishment is to treat it as a remarkable example of literary criticism in its final stage of decline. Starting with I. A. Richards's haphazard serendipity in The Principles of Literary Criticism back in 1924, literary criticism resonated to almost every possibility in the task of interpreting literature. At first genteel formalism seemed dominant, but within a couple decades numerous other possibilities emerged. In its midlife, criticism actually jumped boundaries to grab its piece of the turbulent sixties, only to be curtailed by the double whammy of deconstructionism on the heels of structuralism—the first rooted in Russian formalism, the second in French and German metaphysics. If Richards had been modern criticism's initial prophet, Derrida became its final hierophant, and criticism fell into decrepitude when his vision of hermeneutics at last degenerated into overt religion. Some practitioners have clung to hermeneutic opacity, while others have shifted to feminism, gay studies, multiculturalism, critical biographies, and the like. Nevertheless, the basic critical impetus set in motion eighty-five years ago now seems powerless to sustain itself. Once again authors ignore critics, critics ignore authors, and the literate public at large ignores both more than either seems willing to admit. Illuminating Darkness can accordingly be treated as a kind of suicide note representative of modern literary criticism as a whole. Theory of nothing, let nothing reign—an evocation of theoretical nothingness in the very celebration of its primacy.Why, then, read Illuminating Darkness? Because it does an excellent job making it happen. It is like Hamlet's final line. You want to be able to appreciate its wonderful relevance when Hamlet finally resigns himself to silence. Beyond this, much ado about nothing truly comes of nothing.

As I show, Blanchot's affirmation of what he calls “the impossibility of loving”, which emerges from his reading of Duras, is linked to what he calls “worklessness [désoeuvrement]”; that is, the active process of loosening or undoing that contests any attempt to establish a community around a shared essence. I will claim that it is by attending to the relationship to worklessness that one might attend to what Blanchot calls the “spaces of freedom” that open around us: to those happenings which are not enclosed by prevailing determinations of the social space. A further aim of this paper is to address the concerns of Jacques Derrida, for whom Blanchot's writings on community betray what he calls in Politics of Friendship a “schematic of filiation”, in which the relation to the brother is the privileged model for the relation to the Other.

10.5204/mcj.134,Still: 'No Man's Land' or Never Suspend the Question,John-David C Dewsbury,,2009,2009-03-04,M/C Journal,,article,en,False,"“Say a body. Where none. No mind. Where none. That at least. A place. Where none. For the body. To be in. Move in. Out of. Back into. No out. No back. Only in. Stay in. On in. Still” (Beckett, Short Fiction 471). 1. Introduction – Wherefore to ‘still’?HIRST: As it is?SPOONER: As it is, yes please, absolutely as it is (Pinter, 1971-1981 77). These first lines of Harold Pinter’s play No Man’s Land are indeed the first lines: they were the first lines that came to Pinter, existing as the spark that drove the play into being. Pinter overhead the words ‘As it is’ whilst in a taxi cab and was struck by their poetry and utter uncertainty. That was it. In the play, they are referring to having a scotch – i.e. as it is, without ice. Here, they refer to the ‘still’ – the incessant constitutive moment of being in the world ‘as it is’. In this short paper I want to essay the phenomenon of ‘still’ as it is; as in there is ‘still’, and as in the ‘there is’ is the ‘still’ between presencing and absencing (as in No Man’s Land: two bodies in a room, a question, and a moment of comprehension). Three points need to be outlined from this desire to essay the phenomenon of ‘still’. First, it should be remembered and noted that to essay is to weigh something up in thought. Second, that ‘still’ is to be considered as a phenomena, both material and immaterial, and not as a concept or state, and where our endeavour with phenomenology here is understood as a concern with imagining ‘a body’ and ‘a place’ where there is neither – in this I want to think the vital and the vulnerable in non-oppositional terms “to work against conventional binaries such as stasis–movement, representation–practice (or the non-representational), textual–non-textual, and immaterial–material” (Merrimen et al 193). Third, that I was struck, in the call for papers for this issue of the Journal of Media and Culture, by the invocation of ‘still’ over that of ‘stillness’, or rather the persistent use of ‘still’ in the call focussing attention on ‘still’ as a noun or thing rather than as an adjective or verb. This exploration of being through the essaying of ‘still’ as a phenomenon will be exampled in the work of Samuel Beckett and Pinter and thought through in the philosophical and literary thought of the outside of Maurice Blanchot. Why Beckett? Beckett because he precisely and with distilled measure, exactitude and courage asks the question of being through the vain attempt to stage what remains when everything superfluous is taken away (Knowlson 463): what remains may well be the ‘still’ although this remainder is constitutive of presencing and not a relic or archive or dead space. Why Pinter? Pinter because, through restoring “theatre to its basic elements - an enclosed space and unpredictable dialogue” (Engdaht), he staged a certain vision of our life on earth which pulls on the very logic and power of silence in communication: this logic is that of ‘still’ – saying something while doing nothing; movement where stillness is perceived. Why Blanchot? Blanchot because he understood and gave expression to the fact that that which comes to be written, the work, will not succeed in communicating the experience that drives the writing and that as such the written work unworks the desire that brought it into being (see Smock 4). This ‘unworking’, this putting into question, is the ‘still’. * * * Apart from any other consideration, we are faced with the immense difficulty, if not the impossibility, of verifying the past. I don’t mean merely years ago, but yesterday, this morning. What took place, what was the nature of what took place, what happened? If one can speak of the difficulty of knowing what in fact took place yesterday, one can treat the present in the same way. We won’t know until tomorrow or in six months’ time, and we won’t know then, we’ll have forgotten, or our imagination will have attributed quite false characteristics to today. A moment is sucked away and distorted, often even at the time of its birth. We will all interpret a common experience quite differently, though we prefer to subscribe to the view that there’s a shared common ground, a known ground. I think there’s a shared common ground all right, but that it is more like a quicksand (Pinter, Voices 22). The ‘still’: treating the present in the same manner as the difficulty of knowing the past; seeing the present as being sucked away and distorted at its inception; taking knowing and the constitution of being as grounded on quicksand. At stake then is the work that revolves around the conceptualizations and empirical descriptions of the viscerally engraved being-there and the practical and social formations of embodiment that follow. I am concerned with the ways in which a performative re-emphasizing of practice and materiality has overlooked the central point of what ‘being-there’ means. Which is to say that what ‘being-there’ means has already been assumed in the exciting, extensive and particular engagements which concern themselves more with the different modes of being-there (walking, sitting, sleeping), the different potentialities of onto-technical connections connecting (to) the world (new image technologies, molecular stimulants, practised affecting words), and the various subjectivities produced in the subsequent placements being considered and being made in such connections whether materially or immaterially (imaginary) real (attentive, bored, thoughtful, exhausted). Such engagements do far more than this paper aims for, but what I want for this paper is for it to be a pause in itself, a provocation that takes a step back. What might this step back entail? Let’s start by pivoting off from a phrase that addresses the singular being-there of any performative material moment and that is “the event of corporeal exposure” alluded to by Paul Harrison in his paper ‘Corporeal Remains’ (432). Key to the question of ‘still’ or ‘stillness’ is the tension between thinking the body, embodiment and a sense of life that forms the social when what we are talking about or around is ‘a body. Where none. … A place. Where none’. What briefly do I mean by this? First, what can be said about the presencing of the body? Harrison, following Emmanuel Levinas, both inherits and withdraws from Martin Heidegger’s phenomenology primarily because, and this is what we want to move away from, the key concept of Dasein both covers up the sensible and vulnerable body in being discerned as a disembodied subjectivity and is too concerned forthwith with a sense of comprehension in a teleological economy of intent(ion) (429-430). Second, what is a stake in the ephemeral presence of place? Harrison signals that the eventhood of corporeal existence exists within a “specific relation between interior and exterior”, namely that of “the ‘sudden address from elsewhere’” (436). The Beckettian non-place can be read as that specific relation of the exterior to the interior, of the outside being part of that which brings the sense of self into being. In summary, these two points question the arguments raised by Harrison: ‘What is encountering'? if it isn’t quite the body as nominally thought. And ‘What is encountering?’ if such encountering is a radical asymmetrical address which nonetheless gives some orientation (placement) of comprehension for and of ourselves? 2. What is encountering? Never present still: ‘Say a body. Where none.’Literature is that experience through which the consciousness discovers its being in its inability to lose consciousness, in the movement whereby it disappears, as it tears itself away from the meticulousness of an I, it is re-created beyond consciousness as an impersonal spontaneity (Blanchot, Fire 331-332). I have used the textual extracts from literature and theatre because they present that constitutive and continual tearing away from consciousness (that sense that one is present, embodied, but always in the process of finding meaning or one’s place outside of one’s body). The ‘still’ I want to depict is then the incessant still point of presencing, the moment of disappearance and re-creation: take this passage in Blanchot’s Thomas the Obscure where the eye of the protagonist, Thomas, becomes useless for seeing in the normal way. Read this as a moment where the body doesn’t just function and gain definition within an economy of what we already know it can do, but that it places us and displaces us at the same time towards something more constitutive, indeterminate and existential because it is neither entirely animate flesh nor inanimate corpse but also the traced difference of the past and the differing affirmation of the future:Not only did this eye which saw nothing apprehend something, it apprehended the cause of its vision. It saw as object that which prevented it from seeing. Its own glance entered into it as an image, just when this glance seemed the death of all image (Blanchot, Reader 60). This is the ‘dark gaze’ that Kevin Hart unveils in his excellent book The Dark Gaze: Maurice Blanchot and the Sacred, which he defines as: “the vision of the artist who sees being as image, already separated from the phenomenal world and yet not belonging to a separate order of being” (12). Again this quivering and incessant becoming of ‘a body where none and a place where none’ pushes us towards the openness and exposure of the ‘stilling’ experience of a ‘loss of knowledge’, a lack of comprehension and yet an immediate need for orientation. The ‘still’, shown for Blanchot in the space of literature, distinguishes “itself from the struggle of which it is the dazzling expression … and if it is an answer, the answer to the destiny of the man that calls himself into question, then it is an answer that does not suspend the question” (Blanchot, Fire 343).Thus the phenomenological hegemony that produces “a certain structuring and logos of orientation within the very grammar geographers use to frame spatial experience” (Romanillos 795) is questioned and fractured in the incessant exposure of being by an ever inaccessible outside in which we ironically access ourselves – in other words, find out who or what we are. This is indeed a performance of coherence in always already deconstructing world (Rose). So for me the question of ‘still’ is a question that opens our thought up to the very way in which we think the human, and how we then think the subject in the social in a much more existential and embodied manner. The concern here is less with the biology of this disposition (although I think ultimately such insights need to go in lockstep with the ones I wish to address here) than its ontological constitution. In that sense I am questioning our micro and immediate place-making embodiment and this tasks us to think this embodiment and phenomenological disposition not in a landscape (more broadly or because this concept has become too broad) but in-place. The argument here operates a post-phenomenological and post-humanist bent in arguing for this ‘–place’ to be the neutral ‘there is’ of worlding, and the ‘in-’ to be the always exposed body. One can understand this as the absolute separation of self or other in terms of a non-dialectical account of intersubjectivity (see Critchley 18). In turning to Blanchot the want of the still, “where being ceaselessly perpetuates itself as nothingness” (Blanchot, Space 243), is in ‘showing/forcing us to think’ the strangeness, openness and finitudinal terror of this non-dialectical (non-relational) interhuman relation without the affirmations Levinas makes of an alterity to be understood ethically in some metaphysical sense and in an interpretation of that non-relation as ultimately theological (Critchley 19). What encounters is then the indeterminate, finite and exposed body. 3. What is encountering? The topography of still: ‘A place. Where none’.One of the autobiographical images for Beckett was of an old man holding a child’s hand walking down a country road. But what does this say of being? Embodied being and being-there respectively act as sensation and orientation. The touch of another’s hand is equally a touch of minimal comprehension that acts as a momentary placement. But who is guiding who? Who is pre-occupying and giving occupation to whom? Or take Pinter and the end of No Man’s Land: two men centred in a room one hoping to be employed by the other in order to employ the other back into the ‘land of the living’ rather than wait for death. Are they reflections of the same person, an internal battle to will one’s life to live, or rather to move one’s living fleshy being to an occupation (of place or as a mode by which one opens oneself up to the surroundings in which you literally find oneself – to become occupied by something there and to comprehend in doing so). Either way, is that all there is? Is this how it is? Do we just accept ‘life’ as it is? Or does ‘life’ always move us?HIRST: There is nothing there. Silence SPOONER: No. You are in no man’s land. Which never moves, which never changes, which never grows older, but which remains forever, icy and silent. Silence HIRST: I’ll drink to that (Pinter, Complete Works 157). Disingenuously, taking Pinter at face value here, ‘no man’s land’ is impossible for us, it is literally a land within which no human can be: can you imagine a place where nothing moves, never changes, never ages, but remains forever? Of course you can: we can imagine such a place. The ‘still’ can be made tangible in artistic expressions partly because they provide a means of both communicating that of which we cannot speak and showing the communication of silence when we do not speak. So in the literary spaces of Beckett, Blanchot, and Pinter, “literature as experience is valuable not so much for what it tells us about literature but for what it reveals about experience” (Hart 139-140). So what we have is a communication that reveals but doesn’t define, and that therefore questions the orientation and certainty of subject positions: The literary renderings of certain landscapes, such as those presentations of spatialities outside-the-subject, of the anonymous there is of spaces, contribute to a dismantling and erasure of the phenomenological subject (Romanillos 797). So what I think thinking through ‘still’ can do is bring us to think the ‘neutral presence of life itself’ and thus solicit from us a non-oppositional accounting of vitalism and passivity. “Blanchot asked me: why not pursue my inner experience as if I were the last man?” – for Bataille the answer became a dying from inside without witness, “an impossible moment of paralysis” (Boldt-Irons 3); but for Blanchot it became a “glimpse into ‘the interminable, the incessant’” (ibid) from outside the dying. In other words we, as in humans that comprehend, are also what we are from outside our corporeal being, be that active or passively engaged. But let’s not forget that the outside is as much about actual lived matter and materialized worlds. Whilst what enables us to instil a place in the immaterial flow of absent-presencing or present-absencing is our visceral embodied placement, it is not the body per se but its capacity that enables us to relate or encounter that which is non-relational and that which disrupts our sense of being in place. Herein all sorts of matter (air, earth, water, fire) encounter us and “act as a lure for feeling” (Stengers; after Anderson and Wylie). Pursuing the exposing nature of matter under the notion of ‘interrogation’ Anderson and Wylie site the sensible world as an interrogative agent itself. Wylie’s post-phenomenological folding of the seer and seen, the material and the sensible (2006), is rendered further here in the materialization of Levinas’ call to respond in Lingis’ worlding imperative of “obedience in sensibility” (5) where the materialization is not just the face of the Other that calls but matter itself. It is not just about living, quivering flesh then because “the flesh is a process, not a ‘substance’, in the sense of something which is simply there” (Anderson and Wylie 7). And it is here that I think the ontological accounting of ‘still’ I want to install intervenes: for it is not that there is ever a ‘simply there’ but always a ‘there is’. And this ‘there is’ is not necessarily of sensuality or sensibility, nor is it something vitally felt in one form or another. Rather it persists and insists as a neutral, incessant, interminable presencing that questions us into being: ‘what are we doing here?’ Some form of minimal comprehension must ensue even if it is only ephemeral or only enough to ‘go on’ for a bit more. I can’t go on, you must go on, I’ll go on, you must say words, as long as there are any, until they find me, until they say me, strange pain (Beckett, Unnameable 414). In a sense the question creates the questioner: all sorts of imperatives make us appear. But my point is that they are both of corporeal sensibility, felt pain or pleasure a la Lingis, and minimal comprehension of ontological placement, namely (as shown here) words as they say us, never ours and never finished. The task of reading such stuttering yet formative words is the question ‘still’ presents to social scientific explanation of being bodies in social formations. There is something unreal about the idea of stillness and the assertion that ‘still’ exists as a phenomenon and this unreality rests with the idea that ‘still’ presents both a principle of action and the incapacity to act (see Bissell for exemplary empirics on and theoretical insights into the relational constitution of activity and inactivity) – ‘I can’t go on, you must go on’. There is then a frustrated entitlement of being pre-occupied in space where we gain occupation not in equipmental activity but in the ontological attunement that makes us stall in fascination as a moment of comprehension. Such attunements are constitutive of being and as such are everywhere. They are however more readily seized upon as graspable in those moments of withdrawal from history, those moments that we don’t include when we bio-graph who we are to others, those ‘dull’ moments of pause, quiet, listlessness and apathy. But it is in these moments where, corporeally speaking, a suspension or dampening of sensibility heightens our awareness to perceive our being-there, and thus where we notice our coming to be inbetween heartbeat and thought. Such moments permanently wallpaper our world and as such provide room for perceiving that shadow mode of ‘stillness’ that “produces a strange insectlike buzzing in the margins” (Blanchot, Fire 333). Encountering is then the minimal sense of going on in the face of the questions asked of the body.Let us change the subject. For the last time (Pinter, Dramatic Works 149). Conclusion: ‘For the body. To be in. Move in. Out of. Back into. No out.’Thinking on ‘still’ seems to be a further turn away from vitalism, but such thinking acts as a fear (or a pause and therefore a demand to recognize) that what frightens us, what stills us, is the end of the end, the impossibility of dying (Blanchot, Fire 337): why are we here? But it is this fright that enlivens us both corporeally, in existing as beings, and meaningfully, in our ever ongoing encounter with the ‘there is’ that enables our sense of orientation, towards being something that can say/feel ‘there’.A human being is always on the way toward itself, in becoming, thwarted, thrown-into a situation, primordially ‘‘passive,’’ receptive, attuned, exposed …; far from limiting him, this exposure is the very ground of the emergence of a universe of meaning, of the ‘‘worldliness’’ of man (Žižek 273). The ‘still’ therefore names “the ‘site’ in which the event of Being occurs” (Calarco 34). It comes about from “glimpsing the abyss opened up by the recognition of the perspectival character of human knowledge and the concomitant awareness of … [its] limits” (Calarco 41) – that yes we are death-subjected beings and therefore corporeal and finite. And as such it fashions “a fascination for something ‘outside’ or other than the human” (Calarco 43) – that we are not alone in the world, and the world itself brings us into being. This counterpointing between body and place, sensation and meaning, exists at the very heart of what we call human: namely that we are tasked to know how to go on at the limits of what we know because to go on is the imperative of world. This essay has been a pause then on the circumflexion of ‘still’. If Levinas is right in suggesting that Blanchot overcomes Heidegger’s philosophy of the neuter (Levinas 298) it is because it is not just that we (Dasein) question the ontological from the ontic in which we are thrown but that also the ontological (the outside that ‘stills’ us) questions us:What haunts us is something inaccessible from which we cannot extricate ourselves. It is that which cannot be found and therefore cannot be avoided (Blanchot, Space 259). Thus, as Hart writes, we are transfixed “and risk standing where our ‘here’ will crumble into ‘nowhere’ (150).Neither just vital nor vulnerable, it is about the quick of meaning in the topography of finitude. The resultant non-ontological ethics that comes from this is voiced from an unsuspecting direction in a text written by Jacques Derrida to be read at his funeral. On 12th October 2004 Derrida’s son Pierre gave it oration: “Always prefer life and never cease affirming survival” (Derrida, quoted in Hill 7).

10.1093/fs/knp269,French Interpretations of Heidegger: An Exceptional Reception,John McKeane,,2010,2010-03-29,French Studies,,article,en,False,"The topic addressed underpins much of contemporary French thought, from existentialism to politics and technology, and from deconstruction to the literary. Interventions such as the current one should therefore be applauded for privileging particular questions or approaches. In this light it is a shame that this volume's fourteen essays, many of them excellent, should be preceded by an introduction which is barely more than a consecutive summary of them. Most of those essays address a single issue or thinker in relation to Heidegger: the exceptions are the instructive overviews provided by Dastur and Janicaud (Pettigrew and Raffoul are preparing an eagerly-awaited translation of the latter's important work Heidegger en France [2001]). Beyond this distinction, one can perhaps see that the essays intervene in three arenas. The first is the confrontation between French philosophies of consciousness (Cartesian subjectivity and its inheritors) and philosophies of existence (phenomenology, ontology, existentialism). This means that the fundamental role this confrontation played in Heidegger's thinking can be fruitfully explored by French thinkers who have an intimate knowledge of the former metaphysical system. Essays in the current volume on the positions of Foucault, Levinas, and Sartre in relation to Heidegger pick their way through these debates with varying but often considerable success. The second arena is Heidegger's thinking of the suspensions and framings (in all senses) that take effect between the world, work, or truth on the one hand, and literature or poetry on the other. The essays addressing the relation of Heidegger to Deleuze, Derrida, Irigaray, Lacoue-Labarthe, and Merleau-Ponty gravitate around this aspect (the penultimate particularly impressively). Not only does Heidegger seek to go beyond metaphysics, then; it seems that he also allows a swathe of literary-critical approaches to go beyond and revitalise themselves. It should be said in passing that the volume makes little or no mention of an older generation of writers such as René Char or Maurice Blanchot. This is a particular shame in the latter case, given that Heidegger referred to his writing as that of ‘la meilleure tête pensante en France’. The third and last arena, where a rejuvenation of language is also explored, is the increasingly theological aspect of Heidegger's later work, as well as of recently-available earlier texts. Several essays in this book address these developments. Two of them, by important figures Jean Greisch and Jean-Luc Nancy (the latter's chapter appearing somewhat unnecessarily for the fourth time in as many years) provide insightful discussions of Heidegger's ‘last God’; a third addresses Heidegger's relation to Judaism and hermeneutics as it is played out between factical and textual dwelling. This volume, then, moves across these overlapping areas, and as such it will be of interest to many readers, especially (but not only) those in French studies. The few exasperatingly overblown essays are more than matched by the many valuable or even brilliant interventions.",Biology | Computer science | Consciousness | Database | Deconstruction (building) | Ecology | Epistemology | Existentialism | Fundamental ontology | Metaphysics | Ontology | Phenomenology (philosophy) | Philosophy | Relation (database) | Subjectivity,https://openalex.org/W1559612470,3.0,,OpenAlex,11
10.1080/0969725x.2013.834668,"THE ETHICS OF COMMUNITY<i>nancy, blanchot, esposito</i>",Kristin Lené Hole,,2013,2013-09-01,Angelaki,,article,en,False,"AbstractThis paper analyzes the varying conceptions of ethics underpinning the accounts of community in Blanchot, Nancy, and Esposito. A focus on ethics brings into relief points of divergence amongst accounts of community that otherwise overlap and share in many significant ways. Furthermore, it provides a basis to better assess Esposito's contribution. I focus on the concepts of difference and transcendence and the figure of the lovers, a shared topos in Nancy and Blanchot, to demonstrate these subtle variations. In turning to Esposito, Kantian-inflected notions of duty, obligation, and law shape a community where others recede into the background and the lovers lose their visibility. I suggest that Esposito's focus on duty has consequences that give cause for further reflection. The law renders each of us other, but in its universality it risks losing a sense of the exceptional. Relying etymologically on the notion of duty as that which, following his reading of Kant, undermines the subject and renders possible the impossible community, grounds the Communitas in a law that risks congealing the meaning of community around this impossible obligation.KeywordsBlanchotcommunityEspositoethicsNancy NotesI am indebted to Greg Bird, Jonathan Short, Anne O'Byrne, Dijana Jelaca, and David J. Madden for their insightful comments on earlier drafts of this paper.1 Although Esposito himself does not conceive of his work as political philosophy, it is undoubtedly a philosophy that is deeply engaged with how the political is thought, be it in terms of an affirmative biopolitics or his concept of the impolitical as a response to militant politics in practice and theory. See, for example, Esposito, “Totalitarianism or Biopolitics?”2 For examples of this tendency see Barkan; Bosteels; Campbell, “Bios, Immunity, Life” and “‘Enough of a Self’”; Campbell and Luisetti; Deutscher; Levinson; Minervini; Neyrat; Oliva. Note that the lack of historical engagement with the idea of community is a fault that Bernasconi finds with Nancy's writing on community, namely that it doesn't offer an “historical account of the metaphysical conception of the community that would necessarily underlie any such deconstruction” (15). Esposito's text can be credited with attempting to provide such an historical account.3 See, for example, Elliott; Norris. See James, The Fragmentary Demand for a nuanced discussion of the relationship between philosophy and the political in Nancy.4 See again both Elliott and Norris for very recent examples of this tendency.5 See Gaon who also works in this direction.6 For other accounts of ethics in Blanchot and Nancy's writing on community see Bernasconi; Gaon. See Ingram for further comparison.7 See Bird on how Blanchot and Nancy variously approach the problem of immanentism.8 See Duras.9 See Levinas, Totality and Infinity.10 See, for example, Blanchot's The Instant of my Death; The Space of Literature; The Writing of the Disaster.11 On the Saying/Said see also Levinas, “Language and Proximity.”12 See also O'Byrne, “The Politics of Intrusion” and Natality and Finitude on Nancy and the body, intrusion, and natality.13 Although Nancy states in a footnote that this is an allusion to Lacan, the comment applies equally to Levinas in the context of his argument. See Raffoul on Nancy's critique of the Other in Lacan and Levinas.14 Nancy's concept of “transimmanence” addresses this problematic between transcendence and immanence.15 See Nancy, The Sense of the World and “The Insufficiency of ‘Values’ and the Necessity of ‘Sense.’” See also O'Byrne, Natality and Finitude.16 See also James, “On Interrupted Myth.”17 Compear is Nancy's term for the sharing present at the origin of each person. Rather than appearing, we co-appear or compear; the origin is always multiple. See also “La Comparution/The Compearance.”18 See “Touching” in The Sense of the World.19 See Bosteels; Esposito, “Totalitarianism or Biopolitics?”20 The most relevant texts here are Kant's Critique of Pure Reason; Religion within the Boundaries of Mere Reason; and Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals.21 See Bird, this issue, for a discussion of condivisione in Esposito's writing.22 See also O'Byrne, this issue. The lack of a sustained engagement with sexual difference in Communitas is closely linked to the disappearance of the lovers.23 See Esposito, “For a Philosophy of the Impersonal.”",Aesthetics | Communitas | Duty | Epistemology | Law | Liminality | Obligation | Philosophy | Political science | Politics | Sociology | Theology,https://openalex.org/W1985368613,6.0,,OpenAlex,11
10.4324/9781003045212,Writing Violence and Buddhism in Sri Lanka,Nimmi N. Menike,,2022,2022-03-01,,,book,en,False,"This book examines the idea of violence in the context of religion and literature. It addresses the question of freedom and peace, and violence, with reference to the Buddhist nationalist discourse in Sri Lanka, against the backdrop of Shyam Selvadurai's novel, The Hungry Ghosts. The book discusses love, compassion, emancipation, ethics and responsibility through the concepts of identity, deconstruction and decolonization to view religion as language or writing. With a blend of philosophical insights from Emmanuel Levinas, Jacques Derrida, Maurice Blanchot, and Mahatma Gandhi on ideas of being and the other, differences, nonviolence and forgiveness, it insists on the ethical exigency of reinventing Buddhism in Sri Lanka. Delving into some the central motifs of Selvadurai's novel, suffering, desire, hate, and vengeance, it questions popular Sinhala Buddhist readings to argue for the promise of inclusive and diverse approaches towards various groups, linguistic communities, women, and homosexuality. This book will be useful for scholars and researchers of literature and languages, South Asian literature, literary criticism and theory, linguistics, cultural studies, philosophy, religion, Buddhist studies, diaspora studies, and Sri Lankan literature and sociology.",Ancient history | Archaeology | Buddhism | History | South asia | Sri lanka,https://openalex.org/W4214650896,1.0,,OpenAlex,11

,Blanchot's Mallarme,Kevin Hart,,2008,2008-01-01,,,article,en,,"'Blanchot's Mallarme': the interlacing of these two proper names could be taken to identify either one relationship among many or something essential to modern literature. It would be easy to multiply similar doublings, each with a plausible claim to interest readers of Blanchot. Other than Mallarme, the first literary names that come to mind to pair with Blanchot are Holderlin, Kafka and Bataille, although Sade, Lautreamont, Rilke, Char and Jabe's quickly follow them. Once the list has started to be assembled, the accent seems to shift almost by itself from literature to philosophy, and so we can twin Blanchot with Hegel, Nietzsche, Heidegger or Levinas, or we can go back further into history and name Heraclitus or Socrates, Kant or Kierke - gaard, or, looking among Blanchot's younger contemporaries, league Blanchot with Foucault, Deleuze or Derrida. Reading Blanchot's essays on these diverse authors would confirm what we would have already sensed by reading only two or three pieces, that Blanchot has every - thing of the hedgehog about him and almost nothing of the fox.1 If a case is to be made for the relative importance of Mallarme for Blanchot, it will be based on the continuity and variety of references to his work, and the intensity with which Blanchot identifies an opening of literary space with Mallarme's poetry and poetics, a space to which he has responded faithfully over several decades, in narrative fiction, literary criticism, and fragmentary writing.",Philosophy | Literature | Nothing | Poetry | Narrative | Hegelianism | SOCRATES | Reading (process) | Variety (cybernetics) | Art | Epistemology | Linguistics | Artificial intelligence | Computer science,https://openalex.org/W2561343258,0.0,,OpenAlex,11
,"Religion, Eroticism and Being’s Continuity: A Reading of Kevin Hart in the Light of Bataille’s Theory",Shaoyang Zhang,,2012,2012-06-01,Antipodes eBooks,,book-chapter,en,,"IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT AUSTRALIAN POET KEVIN HART IS interested relationship of theology and deconstruction, and that he is sympathetic to theorists such as Emmanuel Levinas, Maurice Blanchot and Jacques Derrida, as well as to dual tradition of theology (positive and negative). However, it seems to have gone unnoticed that Hart's poetry is also close to thinking of Georges Bataille. To testify to this point, this essay explores how Hart's writing is resonant with Bataille's theory on and eroticism, and demonstrates, meantime, ways of obtaining with deity, or of being, by reading two of his major poems, Hall (Hart, Fiame Tree 192-4) and Madonna (195-200), with some references to Bataille's works, including The ImpossihL·, Story of Eye, and L'ABBE C.The essence of religion [. . .] is search intimacy (Bataille, Theory of Religion 57) or of (St. John, The Collect Works 607). The central Christian model was also adapted and assimilated by Bataille into his theory. According to him, there are two modes of transition relating to beings' and discontinuity: one is to discontinuous, whereas other is to (Bataille, Eroticism 15). The Christian God, on one hand, is being (Hart, The Dark Gaze 42), He had a physical body and became discontinuous when He descended to this secular world from Heaven. On other hand, is a composite possessed of continuity (Bataille, Eroticism 22), He is a self-dependent being. Jesus Christ exemplifies two modes: He descended from Heaven and was incarnated as a human or and ascended to Heaven and returned to continuous being after crucified.The killing or crucifixion of Jesus, no doubt, injures of (Bataille, The Bataille Reader 93), but death of God-man is key step recovering of being, which is seen from two sides. On one hand, Jesus Christ became united with His Father, and on other, mortal beings' desire and longing to have union with Him can be aroused and invigorated by absence and transcendence of God. It is said that death of God and fall committed by humanity are necessary fallen beings to have communication with God and recover intimacy: If human beings had kept their own integrity and hadn't sinned, God on one hand and human beings on other would have persevered their respective isolation, and communication between God and humanity would have become impossible, love that is guaranteed by crime (93). Thus Jesus Christ, from kenosis to transcendence, not only sets an example mortal beings or beings to follow, but also creates a basic condition of necessity humanity to have communications with deity and to achieve totality.That said, nevertheless, it is not necessary mortal or discontinuous beings to perish physically to obtain lost continuity that we yearn for (Bataille, Eroticism 15), there remains an alternative way humanity to fulfill realization of an identity with totality- one can search deity by having a desire obtaining it. The humanity of an organism seek(s) elements around it (or outside it) which are immanent to it and with which it must establish (relatively stabilize) relations of immanence (Bataille, Theory of Religion 19), the flow (the immanence) is outside to inside, from inside to outside, which is organic life, only lasts under certain conditions (20) and it may sometimes be in a sudden movement of transcendence, where tangible matter is surpassed. [. . .] In this way intelligible world has appearance of divine (73). This movement of transcendence and union reminds us of functions of Church, bread and raisin wine (Holy Bible, Matthew 26:26-28; Markl4:22-24). …",Eroticism | Heaven | Philosophy | Poetry | Deconstruction (building) | Reading (process) | Literature | Close reading | Art history | Theology | Art | Human sexuality | Sociology | Gender studies | Ecology | Linguistics | Biology,https://openalex.org/W385572631,1.0,,OpenAlex,11

,Towards the impossibility of childhood : Maurice Blanchot's '(A primal scene?)',Beth Guilding,,2017,2017-01-01,,,dissertation,en,,"This thesis traces a subtle, but central, concern of
Blanchot’s works: that of childhood and its relation to
the silence in language. Beginning with an in-depth
analysis of the commentary surrounding the fragment
from Blanchot’s text, The Writing of the Disaster
(1980), titled ‘(A primal scene?)’, our introduction and
first two chapters examines the way that Freud and
Blanchot come into conjunction with one another
through their shared focus on the importance of the
origin and its relation to the silence of the Other.

From here, we move into an examination of
Blanchot’s use of fragmentary writing. Our aim is to
demonstrate the manner in which the ‘secret’ in which
the child of ‘(A primal scene?)’ shall ‘live henceforth’
enters into a relationship with the ‘nondialectical’
Other; the Other that (or who) for Blanchot enables
language to be possible within the realms of the
impossible.

This will lead us into an examination of the
theme of childhood as it occurs more generally
throughout Blanchot’s oeuvre. Examining the works of
Louis-Rene des Forets alongside Blanchot’s texts ‘The
Last Word’ and A Voice from Elsewhere, we will argue
that, when Blanchot writes that childhood is the period
of ‘the impossibility of speaking’, he is gesturing
toward the way that childhood and death are
incorporated into the adult’s language through the
silence that both maintain within the Self.

We will conclude by arguing that, for Blanchot,
the reason that ‘every poet is Narcissus’ is because
every poet is turned away from herself in the act of
writing, thereby allowing the silence of childhood and
death to come forth as the ‘secret’ of language.",Impossibility | Silence | Relation (database) | Theme (computing) | Literature | History | Psychoanalysis | Art | Psychology | Aesthetics | Computer science | Law | Political science | Database | Operating system,https://openalex.org/W2625863864,0.0,,OpenAlex,10

I argue that Blanchot never relinquished the purist modernist idea of the privilege of writing and with it the privilege of his own self-identification primarily as a writer. It is my contention that this emphasis sometimes obfuscated his vision, both conceptually and politically.

Em Thomás, L´Obscur, os temas de um vitalismo a contrapelo, que segue de perto os problemas colocados pela morte imanente à vida, se transpõem numa caracterização importante do que compreende como espaço literário. Tentamos mostrar como sua criação se estende para além do campo literário, dando a ver uma ontologia da linguagem e uma experiência intensiva do real. Apesar de serem incorporados criticamente alguns conceitos bergsonianos (ao invés de vida, duração e memória, o que se passa em Blanchot é morte, instante e esquecimento), não se trata propriamente de ir numa contramão.

L’exil, quant à lui revêt une inflexion plus dramatique, car, au contraire de la tradition juive, Blanchot l’envisage dans la démesure d’un mouvement sans fin. Il analyse l’exil comme la conjugaison du retrait divin, de la dispersion d’Israël et de l’incondition d’écrivain.

It takes the form of a radical nihilism open to the outside, where a swatch of irredeemable negativity exposes language and being to a corrosive contaminant while effacing all transcendental signifieds. The result is the impenitent-the forgetting that antedates all memory. Yet the trace of the immemorial persists and persistently indicates the beyond being, which is the sacred. A light-hearted unconcern-a kind of reduction of ontic appropriativity-then constitutes a way to (of) the outside, a non-place absolutely lacking in an inside. Metaphorically, the insouciance of casual reading (rather than one that digs for the profundity) offers access to an inaccessible text, a text made inaccessible by the reach for meaning. The sacrifice Blanchot has in mind, in going beyond that of the object of thought, requires a total rehabilitation of thinking.

It is this beginning that this article sets out to explore. In particular, it examines how Blanchot's discourse, insofar as the literature/politics relation is concerned, begins to shift toward the second half of the 1930s. Initially, literature is seen as a propitious ground to prepare what Blanchot terms a ‘healthy’ politics — not in any partisan or programmatic sense but in the more fundamental sense of being the active site of what he refers to as ‘concrete’ values, that is, national, cultural and spiritual values which may call upon writers to commit themselves politically and take action to defend those values in the real world as part of an effort to stimulate national, spiritual renewal. Gradually, however, Blanchot's discourse breaks with this logic of continuity established between literature and the field of political realities. From 1937 onwards, the political element provides Blanchot, this time in the form of a revolutionary force detached from its empirical conditions, with a conceptual framework to theorize literature and to account for the violent, negating force encountered, according to him, in the literary work. As a result, it is no longer — or just — about literature contributing to a revolutionary project in the socio-political world; what is at stake, instead, is how the political, understood (conceptually rather than empirically) as a ‘force of opposition’ or negation, can contribute to literary criticism and thought by offering Blanchot a new language to explore the experience and violence of literature.",Aesthetics | Commit | Computer science | Criticism | Database | Element (criminal law) | Epistemology | Law | Linguistics | Negation | Opposition (politics) | Philosophy | Political science | Politics | Relation (database) | Sociology,https://openalex.org/W2160460554,1.0,,"Crossref, OpenAlex",10

10.5565/rev/enrahonar.1435,The ethics of poetic expression in Emmanuel Lévinas and Maurice Blanchot,Berta Galofré Claret,,2022,2022-10-25,Enrahonar An international journal of theoretical and practical reason,,article,en,False,"Lévinas believed that Blanchot identified artistic inspiration with his understanding of the il y a, that is, an inauthentic attitude toward life and the Other. Lévinas, who tried to overcome the neutrality of the il y a, criticised Blanchot’s desire to establish ethics as a prima philosophia. Lévinas asked himself in what way the artwork could give access to the ethical, which is why he explored the relationship between expression and responsibility. He concluded that poetic speaking was excluded from his understanding of ethical language. Therefore, Lévinas was against poetic activity, in ethical terms, because poetic activity (dis)possessed the subject/artist in such a way that the creator was not able to control his writing, which converted art into the worst kind of irresponsibility. This paper will focus on Lévinas’ first aesthetic period, and on the ideas collected in the essay La Réalité et son ombre, published in 1948.",Art | Computer science | Epistemology | Expression (computer science) | Focus (optics) | Library science | Linguistics | Literature | Neutrality | Optics | Philosophy | Physics | Poetry | Programming language | Subject (documents),https://openalex.org/W4307368882,0.0,,OpenAlex,10

Cette déconstruction l'a conduit à réfléchir sur le travail de deuil de la pensée moderne à l'égard de tout nom, fondateur de l'histoire et du sujet, pour reconnaître justement une nouvelle éthique où le nom de l'Autre doit rester de l'ordre de l'innommable ou de l'anonymat.

This text, Thomas l’Obscur, is a 300-page work which appeared in 1941, only to be succeeded in 1950 by a narrative one-third of the length: Thomas l’Obscur, nouvelle version. The longer work is untranslated, whilst the shorter one was rendered into English by Robert Lamberton in 1973.1 Having begun by working only with the French text, I then brought in Lamberton’s translation of the second Thomas by way of comparison. This was enlightening: perhaps because it is American rather than British English, or perhaps because it translates a much-compressed text, Lamberton’s language was often brisker than mine, and I acknowledge my debt to him where I have adopted his turns of phrase. The question is an interesting one because when compared with the 1950 version, the 1941 version of Thomas l’Obscur is anything but brisk. The narration situates the reader within a sensorily overwhelming experience, rather than looking at it from the outside. Therefore, I have made several choices (especially with past tenses) highlighting the continuous, unfolding, live nature of the experience recounted in the chapter.",Art | History | Linguistics | Literature | Narrative | Philosophy | Phrase,https://openalex.org/W3002489360,0.0,,"Crossref, OpenAlex",10

10.1093/fs/knv290,"Haptic Experience in the Writings of Georges Bataille, Maurice Blanchot and Michel Serres",Gary D. Mole,,2015,2015-11-03,French Studies,Liverpool University Press,article,en,False,"In this dense and challenging study, Crispin T. Lee amply demonstrates that the haptic experience announced in the title is not confined to the strict discipline of cognitive psychology. Rather, his ambitious project is to relate four theories of haptic perception (simply put, the process of recognizing objects through touch) to the critical theories and literary prose of his three chosen ‘writer-philosophers’. Accordingly, Lee spends much of his Introduction giving a detailed exposition of how the haptic is conceived and theorized in the writings of the late-nineteenth-century Viennese art historian Aloïs Riegl who uses the term haptisch to refer to painted, sculpted, or constructed surfaces exhibiting overtly tactile or visual detail; in Laura U. Marks's The Skin of the Film: Intercultural Cinema, Embodiment, and the Senses (Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 2000), which places haptic visuality in the context of the cinematic; in Mark Paterson's The Senses of Touch: Haptics, Affects and Technologies (Oxford: Berg, 2007), concentrating on ‘proprioception’ (the cutaneous, tactile, kinaesthetic, and vestibular senses) and the decorporealization of sensations where technological advances can now allow haptic interaction to be divorced from physical proximity (virtual reality); and finally in Jean-Luc Nancy's understanding of the haptic across a number of texts with his particular emphasis on sensory zones and the concept of ‘excription’. Lee then delineates his corpus of texts by Bataille, Blanchot, and Serres before devoting a lengthy chapter to each writer. The chapters are constructed in an identical manner, with Lee first identifying the haptic (even if not explicitly named) in certain theoretical and critical writings of the writer concerned, and then offering largely thematic readings of how this plays out in aspects or specific scenes of three literary texts: for Bataille, Histoire de l'œil, Madame Edwarda, and Le Bleu du ciel; for Blanchot, Thomas l'obscur (première version), La Folie du jour, and L'Instant de ma mort; for Serres, Les Cinq sens, Le Tiers-instruit, and La Guerre mondiale. Seasoned readers of Bataille and Blanchot may initially be surprised to learn that haptic perception is an ‘inescapable touchstone’ (p. 39) of their critical and literary texts, but Lee's arguments are cogently advanced, and the critical attention given to Serres's sometimes inscrutable work is equally illuminating, in particular how Serres's writing has evolved over the last thirty years, with ‘theory and dry terminology [giving] way to erudition and etymological analyses’ (p. 202). Given the genuinely difficult nature and theoretical sophistication of much of the material discussed, Lee generously offers to help by constantly repeating hypotheses, anticipating arguments, summarizing conclusions before reaching them, highlighting differences and similarities between his thinkers, and relating their preoccupations to one or more of the haptic theories previously analysed. Like the subtitles guiding us from one section to another, this all proves useful even if it does also create an impression of the painstakingly doctoral. Still, Lee's erudite engagement with the deeply philosophical aspects of his triumvirate of writers, as well as with his four haptic theorists, is impressive indeed. Scholars and graduate students of any one of these writers and theorists may beg to differ with certain interpretations, but they will also find much here to explore and pursue.",Aesthetics | Archaeology | Art | Artificial intelligence | Cognitive science | Computer science | Context (archaeology) | Haptic technology | History | Movie theater | Neuroscience | Perception | Psychology | Visual arts,https://openalex.org/W2259824967,1.0,,"Crossref, OpenAlex",10

On y voit revenir quelques idoles: Giraudoux, Mallarmé, Valéry, les surréalistes français et les romantiques allemands. La critique de Blanchot n'est pas une critique universitaire. C'est d'abord une critique de jugement, qui ouvre la voie à une critique d'interprétation. C'est aussi une critique d'écrivain, qui se tient au plus près de l'acte de création.

,La comunidad en obra: Jean-Luc Nancy en diálogo con Maurice Blanchot: un desacuerdo tácito,Aukje van Rooden,,2011,2011-01-01,Pléyade,,article,es,,"Desde la nocion nancyana de comunidad como estar-en-comun, cuya formacion no se puede determinar ni realizarse desde una esencia, ni como origen, destino o proyecto, sino como el simple estar juntos de las singularidades, mas alla de su fundacion, legitimacion o voluntad de sistema, el texto pretende acercarse a cierta nocion de comunicacion como otra praxis del discurso. Alli se jugaria, en la nocion de literatura como inoperancia, un desacuerdo tacito entre Nancy y Blanchot, que encuentra su lugar en las distintas concepciones de la literatura y el lenguaje. Si bien ambos autores se acercan en una teoria del lenguaje deconstructiva o diferencial, y jamas se critican explicitamente el uno al otro, el desacuerdo tacito alcanza la cuestion de la relacion entre literatura y ontologia. El texto aventura que mientras lapoetica ontologica de Nancy es de inspiracion heideggeriana, el lenguaje literario en Blanchot es de caracter mallarmeano. Esta diferencia apunta a que el plano ontologico sobre el que Nancy concibe la comunidad, como estar singlar plural, como inoperancia que se resiste a ser obra, no radica solo en un asunto de lenguaje literario sino de la existencia como el murmullo silencioso de las cosas mismas, mientras que el estatuto poetico desde el que Blanchot comprende esta nocion de inoperancia, como aquella suspension que no es separable de la obra, como el movimiento inconfesable que se da en ycomo una obra literaria,a la vez supone, pues, cierto obramiento.",Humanities | Philosophy | Art,https://openalex.org/W175619001,1.0,,OpenAlex,10

Pas davantage qu'il ne tient necessairement a l'itineraire politique de Blanchot. S'agissant de ce lien, nous nous proposons de reflechir sur la voix, un langage specifique de la litterature chez Blanchot. La question de la voix est ici la question centrale. La voix est, nous allons le voir dans cette etude, le mode de parole communautaire dans la litterature. Mais pour l'interroger a la lumiere de l'ensemble de la pensee de Blanchot, qui ne se delimite pas dans la litterature, nous nous deplacerons hors du cadre de la litterature (chapitre I et chapitre II). . .",Humanities | Philosophy | Art,https://openalex.org/W81016862,0.0,,OpenAlex,10

,The Imagination: Distance and Relation in Maurice Blanchot and Ibn'Arabi,Hossein Moradi,,2014,2014-06-25,,,article,en,,"Blanchot discusses two versions of imagination. The first version, as the copy of an object, is premeditated or provoked by the conscious process of the mind, whereas in the second version, of the image, a thing becomes a complete empty space outside human consciousness and finds the opportunity to shine itself in itself and for itself. The object never resembles anything but itself, the image of itself. This paper argues that with Blanchot, the human in confrontation with the thing in itself in a passive and neutral relation becomes the image of itself. Keeping a distance from each other not for the sake of knowing and comprehension, both the object and the human are at perpetual distance . While thinking of Blanchot's relationship and distance , it is argued that Ibn 'Arabi's idea of barzakh is the space of imagination, an intermediate reality works through distancing and setting relationship . In this sense, Ibn 'Arabi goes outside ontological horizons believing in essence or existence.",Relation (database) | Object (grammar) | Distancing | Consciousness | Philosophy | Epistemology | Metaphysics | Space (punctuation) | Computer science | Linguistics | Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) | Medicine | Disease | Pathology | Database | Infectious disease (medical specialty),https://openalex.org/W1541846420,0.0,,OpenAlex,10

A travers l'etude des archives de Blanchot, la presente recherche analyse la maniere dont il s'approprie plusieurs intertextes de la tradition juive. Il apparait qu'au-dela du commentaire de ces oeuvres, Blanchot gomme frequemment les frontieres entre son discours et les intertextes cites, il tend a une heterogeneite masquee qui se reclame d'une ecriture de l'anonymat. Outre cet effet d'exogreffe, la tradition juive est l'objet d'un questionnement incessant, partir de certains motifs qui vont constituer une mythographie du juif : la naissance du langage, le sacrifice, le nomadisme, l'exil, l'exode, la revelation, l'interpretation de la loi. Par ailleurs, les derniers textes de Blanchot, particulierement les ecrits fragmentaires laissent entrevoir une pensee messianique qui subvertit radicalement notre pensee du temps.",Humanities | Philosophy | Art | Ethnology | History,https://openalex.org/W67517796,0.0,,OpenAlex,10

,La folie d'écrire chez Maurice Blanchot,Kyou-Hyone Park,,2000,2000-01-01,,,dissertation,fr,,"Dans l'ecriture du desastre, ce qu'on veut saisir par le mouvement d'ecrire n'est pas la continuite du mouvement, mais le moment de defaillance, de rupture au centre de l'ecriture en constatant l'absence de centre, d'origine. C'est le propre de la folie d'ecrire de se produire dans l'ecriture meme. Par la, ce qui nous met, nous lecteurs, en difficulte de saisir sa pensee, est que la pensee blanchotienne figuree dans son ecriture est situee a un point ou l'ecriture s'annule. Il faut noter que le > n'est pas un simple arret d'ecriture mais la rencontre avec le > qui est en train d'ecrire encore, autrement dit, avec ce qui envahit l'ecriture de l'ecrivain. Ecrire > renvoie ecrire a la >, et a partir de la, l'ecriture devient un jeu. L'ecriture blanchotienne est la recherche interminable de l'etablissement d'un rapport avec le dehors ou s'abrite le lointain passe. C'est a partir de ce probleme du rapport avec le passe anterieur que nous examinons le moment ou l'ecriture rejoint la lecture qui la precede. Pour la jointure du passe anterieur, nous soulignons la necessite de la disparition du sujet pour qu'il y ait un espace vide. L'espace du poeme s'instaure dans cet espace vacant. Lorsque blanchot dit que la lecture est > et que, >, la lecture consiste a dire l'interpretation, >. C'est la decouverte de l'essence de la poesie.

,Le statut imaginaire de l'etre chez maurice blanchot,Hyun Joo Kin,,1998,1998-01-01,,,dissertation,fr,,"Les images sont la seconde vie, et cette seconde vie, ou plutot cet espace second n'est nullement marginal par rapport a la vie positive et reelle, au contraire il l'impregne, il la hante tout entiere. Il se tient en elle comme une dimension qui la double, a la fois la plus intime et la plus insaisissasble, ou se jouent les figures des desirs, des reves, des souvenirs. La question de l'image chez blanchot, a plus forte raison de l'image fascinante, n'est donc nullement une question vaine ou futile, elle est au coeur de l'existence, qui sans elle ne serait pas ce qu'elle est. Or, l'image fascinante est une image qui nous fait nous interroger sur sa nature d'image, et par suite sur la realite meme. Et l'imaginaire reside dans l'ambiguite constitutive de l'image, laquelle nous fait tendre a travers l'irreel vers une realite qui n'existe que dans la mesure ou elle se rend insaisissable. Par consequent, ce que blanchot nous devoile n'est nullement la verite de l'image. Car il n'y a pas de verite de l'image, et l'image se projette toujours, non vers un etre, mais vers une absence d'etre. Ce qu'il nous revele est donc comment ce qui n'est jamais que par defaut, ce qui n'existe que par son absence, peut susciter en nous une interrogation qui ne se separe pas de notre vie. Ici l'etre va exiger le statut imaginaire, designe comme neutre. Dans ces conditions nous tenterons une approche des oeuvres qui laissera se degager les implications essentielles auxquelles conduit le choix d'un des deux termes : l'etre et le non-etre, le reel et l'irreel. Et cela va nous amener a decouvrir une conception de l'imaginaire qui remodele le champ de l'experience humaine tout entiere.",Humanities | Philosophy,https://openalex.org/W585224052,0.0,,OpenAlex,10

L’incomprehension suppose en realite une difficulte d’un autre ordre, une difficulte dans l’identification d’une realite intellectuelle, conceptuelle, une difficulte dans la connaissance du mot comme experience interieure. C’est pourquoi, l’incomprehension des mots reveille la pensee et l’etre. Pour les grands ecrivains, ceux qui font œuvre de style, la force du mot est au-dela du mot, au-dela de sa forme acoustique et semantique.

A relacao entre literatura e revolucao pode ser dividida em tres momentos: em relacao ao imaginario e a negatividade; em relacao ao valor e a palavra inutil; em relacao ao carater fragmentario da literatura. O imaginario e a passagem, sem as mediacoes do tempo, do nada ao tudo, assim como a revolucao inverte o regime politico vigente. Para Blanchot, a literatura e um valor que nao se avalia, o que exige uma forma de afirmacao que supere a nocao de valor, indo ao encontro do surrealismo como estetica revolucionaria.",Philosophy | Humanities,https://openalex.org/W2788951021,0.0,,OpenAlex,10

,L'inconstance de la voix narrative dans les récits de Maurice Blanchot,Tatiana Nikishina,,2014,2014-01-01,,,dissertation,fr,,"Ce travail se propose de prendre au serieux l'affirmation de Blanchot selon laquelle la litterature n'est pas affaire de signification mais de mouvement. La dynamique de la voix narrative est visee dans les perspectives semiotique et linguo-rhetorique, ce qui permet de mettre en lumiere la double exigence de l'ecriture blanchotienne, a la fois critique et fictionnelle, et de confronter la these d'une oeuvre narrative critique et d'une oeuvre theorique creative de Blanchot. Le rapport de non-identite de la voix narrative est examine dans ce travail dans trois perspectives differentes, quoique liees. Dans la premiere partie, le principe, la methode critique et l'ethos de l'ambiguite essentielle sont etudies en tant que composantes strategiques de la demarche critique blanchotienne des annees 1940-1950. La deuxieme partie s'interesse particulierement a la pratique singuliere de l'image — la pratique de dissimulation — dans les recits blanchotiens, au sein de laquelle emerge le point de non-coincidence de la voix narrative avec elle-meme. C'est a partir de ce point que nous abordons la visibilite narrative en tant que phenomene complexe qui associe les aspects semantiques et axiologiques a une pratique mimique du discours blanchotien. La troisieme partie se penche sur les pratiques d'accueil et d'inscription de la distance dans les recits, ou celle-ci provoque la destabilisation interieure du dispositif narratif, ce qui met en question toute approche narratologique de ces textes. L'analyse detaillee et progressive de Celui qui ne m'accompagnait pas permet de mettre en relief la passion du desequilibre et la passion desequilibree de l'ecriture blanchotienne.",Humanities | Philosophy | Narrative | Art | Linguistics,https://openalex.org/W3129118176,0.0,,OpenAlex,10

,Le neutre à l'œuvre dans les récits de Maurice Blanchot,Denis Aucouturier,,2003,2003-01-01,,,dissertation,fr,,"Trois recits de Blanchot : Celui Dernier homme et L'Attente l'Oubli qui sont l'occasion de se pencher sur l'œuvre fictionnelle se situant au tournant d'une ecriture. L'Attente l'Oubli est a la fois le dernier recit qui s'apparente aux precedents et celui qui marque le debut d'une ecriture fragmentaire. Les recits narrent un questionnement face a l'ecriture en mettant en scene l'ipseite, l'Un face a la necessite d'ecart que supposent langage et ecriture. Trois mouvements partent de l'Un. Le premier va de l'Un au Neutre en passant par un equilibre d'ecart puis s'en liberant. Le second concerne le rapport de l'Un a l'autre. Les relations entre personnages posent la question de l'alterite, centree sur l'ecart necessaire a toute communication. Le troisieme mouvement va de l'Unite au fragment selon une volonte d'immediatete dans l'ecriture qui tendrait a reduire l'ecart. La question du temps est primordiale. L'ecart, c'est le differe, c'est l'analyse qui, a cause du temps qu'elle necessite, eloigne de la verite immediate. Blanchot detourne la question intraitable du temps en envisageant le present en association avec la presence. 'Un quelque chose' de fondamental existe, universel et atemporel et transforme un temps en un espace. Le neutre est l'objet d'une quete en meme temps qu'un sujet en quete. En matiere d'alterite, les fusions finales de personnages des recits se traduisent par la neutralite de l'effacement du je. Dans l'espace fragmentaire, le neutre correspond a l'effacement de celui qui ecrit (transcrit sans analyse). En matiere de temporalite le toujours deja, l'universalite, l'abolition du present effacent le present de l'ecriture et ainsi la neutralisent. Enfin la neutralite inspire car l'effacement laisse place a la parole de l'autre. Toute reflexion sur l'ecriture de Blanchot, de par l'influence qu'elle exerce, de par son autorite, se fait sous le signe de la disparition, de l'insaisissable, du neutre a l'œuvre.",Humanities | Philosophy | Art,https://openalex.org/W159339043,0.0,,OpenAlex,10

,"L'exigence d'une parole plurielle : littérature, pensée et communauté dans l'oeuvre de Maurice Blanchot",Idoia Quintana Domínguez,,2013,2013-01-01,,,article,en,,"The main objective of this thesis will consist on the study of the operations by which Blanchot will make evident the instability of an organized metaphysical knowledge from the dualities of presence and absence, actuality and virtuality, continuity and discontinuity, “selfness” and alterity. To do this, we will pay special attention to the “logic” Blanchot uses to draw a neutral space of exteriority, of the interruption and the detour. In the movement that oscillates between an experience that installs and gets installed out of the order of what is possible and an infinite demand to welcome the “other like the other”, this interrogation will be transfered to the literature, to the thinking and to the community. This multiple aspects will make clear both the plural speech of Blanchot as well as a non-unified talk in a speech, a talk that requires a plurality of approximations, of indirect paths and detours. Through this detours, we will carry out a reading of the texts of Blanchot, where, while operating a suspension of the thetic power of thought, we will find an opening to different possibilities of sense.",Interrogation | Metaphysics | Plural | Epistemology | Virtuality (gaming) | Philosophy | Computer science | Sociology | Linguistics | Artificial intelligence | Law | Political science,https://openalex.org/W1780738943,0.0,,OpenAlex,10

He is the editor of other ‘the-Hardy-of-biography’ work(s) including The Life and Work of Thomas Hardy (London: Macmillan, 1984) (604 pages). Indeed, he must be accounted the doyen of Hardy biography and scholarship, despite, inter alia, the late Martin Seymour-Smith's (900-page) would-be ‘spanner in the works’ (Hardy [London: Bloomsbury, 1994]), which savagely attacks Michael Millgate and the influential scholar R.L. Purdy for what he takes to be their over-reliance on the testimony of second wife Florence as a depressed, and disloyal partner, nicely self-interested (and deeply problematic as a keeper of the posthumous ‘informatic flow’ about Hardy), and a sense of patronage towards Hardy ‘carried over’ from Robert Gittings' brilliantly researched but almost (one might say) philistine investigations of the 70s, which stunningly conveyed the remoteness and even savagery of Hardy's early nineteenth century social context in his Young Thomas Hardy (London: Heinemann, 1975) (259 pages) and The Older Thomas Hardy (London: Heinemann, 1978) (244 pages). More respectfully, I suggest some ideas as to what might be ‘wrong with’ biography and that of Hardy in particular in ‘Oh, Keep the Dog far Hence’: Hardy, Bersani and Biography,' Oxford Literary Review, 20 (1998), 163–171. Also well known is a recent intervention by Claire Tomalin in Thomas Hardy: The Time-Torn Man (London: Penguin, 2006) (486 pages). She is a genuine literary scholar, but with little interest in developments in critical thought and theory, and the journalistic rapture which greets her biographical productions is a little suspect. And a number of other biographical works would be regarded as ‘essential reading’ if we assume biography to be ‘essential’, including James Gibson's Thomas Hardy: A Literary Life (London: Macmillan, 1996) (206 pages) and Paul Turner's The Life of Thomas Hardy: A Critical Biography (Oxford: Blackwell, 1998) (326 pages). The first work on Hardy with a quotient of biography appeared in 1911. (There have been many since.) ‘The Ivy-Wife’ is the title of a poem in Wessex Poems (1898): now in The Complete Poems of Thomas Hardy, ed. James Gibson (London: Macmillan, 1976), p. 57. A phrase from ‘Wessex Heights’ (dated ‘1896’): in The Complete Poems of Thomas Hardy, p. 319. Fredric Jameson, Marxism and Form: Twentieth-Century Dialectical Theories of Literature (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1971), p. 55. Jacques Derrida, Aporias, trans. Thomas Dutoit (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1993), p. 14. This appeared in French as ‘Apories: Mourir-s'attendre aux limites de la vérité’, in Le Passage des Frontières: Autour du Travail de Jacques Derrida (Paris: Éditions Galilée, 1994), 309–338, as part of a ‘Colloque de Cérisy’: ‘la liste interminable de tous les quasi-concepts dits indécidables qui sont autant de lieux ou de dislocations . . . (p. 314). Thomas Hardy, Two on a Tower: A Romance (1882) (London: Penguin, 1995), p. 3. Hardy finesses over the deployment of this word to describe male attractiveness but implies it, indicating, as he does throughout, gender asymmetricality. Even Professor Ralph Pite perhaps suggests this kind of lopsidedness in describing Viviette as ‘too susceptible to Swithin's charms to be quite admirable’, &c. in Thomas Hardy: The Guarded Life (London: Picador, 2006), p. 271. Caroline Austen, Jane Austen's niece, writing in 1867: Deirdre Le Faye, Jane Austen: A Family Record (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2004), p. 277. For starting-points see the Encyclopaedia of Postmodernism, ed. Victor E. Taylor and Charles E. Winquist (London: Routledge, 2001), pp. 15–16, which refers to Jacques Derrida's Aporias (1993). In The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1990): p. 152. According to Christina Ruse and Marilyn Hopton, in The Cassell Dictionary of Literary and Language Terms (London: Cassell, 1992), the word ‘novella’ is ‘now often used interchangeably with novelette’ (p. 199), a hard saying given the pejorative connotations often assigned to the word ‘novelette’; yet in a sense Two on a Tower might be seen as a sort of ‘apotheosis of the novelette’. Freud, Standard Edition of the Works IX, ed. James Strachey (London: Hogarth Press, 1959), p. 238: ‘the child's imagination becomes engaged in the task of getting free from the parents of whom he now has a low opinion, and of replacing them by others, who, as a rule, are of a higher social standing’. See Michael Millgate, Thomas Hardy: A Biography Revisited (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004), pp. 48–49. Hardy ungallantly awarded her surname to the hero's grandmother here (p. 15). Millgate, Thomas Hardy: A Biography Revisited, p. 188. The phrase occurs in an article of 1881. This essay is reproduced in A Barthes Reader, ed. Susan Sontag (London: Jonathan Cape, 1982), pp. 185–193: p. 187. Published as ‘Écrivains et Écrivants’, in Essais Critiques (Paris: Éditions du Seuil, 1964), pp. 147–154: ‘Et le miracle, si l'on peut dire, c'est que cette activité narcissistique ne cesse de provoquer, au long d'une littérature séculaire, une interrogation au monde’ (p. 149). Shlomith Rimmon-Kenan, Narrative Fiction: Contemporary Poetics (London: Methuen, 1983), p. 33. The role of pieces on the chess board is not well explicated by histories of knights or castles. See Paul Turner, The Life of Thomas Hardy: A Critical Biography (Oxford: Blackwell, 1998), p. 87. The reference is to the 24th edition of the Eton Latin Grammar, ed. T.W.C. Edwards (1850). For some of the immediate scientific stimuli for Two on a Tower, see Gillian Beer, Open Fields: Science in Cultural Encounter (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1996), p. 286. Hardy's feeling for nature is that of the Romantic poets, but a contemporary mentor in such matters was J.S. Mill, eloquent on the theme of a Tennyson-like ‘Nature red in tooth and claw’ (‘In Memoriam’, 1850); see Mill's essay on ‘Nature’ in Three Essays on Religion (1874). Hardy would have found comic Edward Young's idea as expressed in Night Thoughts (1750) that ‘Nature is Christian; preaches to mankind . . .’ an idea which the Victorian Temper was attempting to ‘re-rehearse’. Presumably he would not have disagreed with Baudelaire's ‘La Nature est un temple o[ugrave] de vivants piliers/ Laissent parfois sortir de confuses paroles’ (1857), although of course this leaves unclear just how ‘helpful’ Nature as ‘communicator’ is capable of being: Stanley Burnshaw glosses confuses paroles as ‘indistinct words’, then, appropriately dissatisfied, has another try with ‘allows confused words to escape’, in The Poem Itself (London: Penguin, 1964). See also Nicole Ward Jouve, Baudelaire (London: Macmillan, 1980), p. 32. To appropriate Ted Benton's words to apply to Hardy here, ‘[he] understands that Darwin's intellectual project is anti-anthropocentric, that his theory does not attribute conscious intention to natural forces, and that he does not think that living organisms are designed by a creator . . .’ although this is by way of being what Althusser would call (his) ‘theoretical raw material’ rather than the intellectual horizon of the novel's discourse: see ‘Science, Ideology and Culture: Malthus and The Origin of Species’, in Charles Darwin's ‘The Origin of Species: New Interdisciplinary Essays, ed. David Amigoni and Jeff Wallace (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1995), pp. 73–74, p. 90. Shakespeare, ‘Sonnet 20’, in: Shakespeare's Sonnets, ed. Katherine Duncan-Jones (London: Thomas Nelson, 1997), p. 20. As Richard Dawkins claims in A Devil's Chaplain: Selected Essays, ed. Latha Menon (London: Weidenfeld and Nicholson, 2003), p. 146: Ipse dixit. Margaretta Jolly, ‘Feminist Heterosexuality’, Critical Quarterly, 47 (October, 2005), p. 17. Or, as we might put it, ‘the spectre of feminism is haunting Two on a Tower’: see, e.g. ‘Hauntology or the Political? (Or, No Politics, not Now)’, in Julian Wolfreys, Occasional Deconstructions (Albany: State University of New York Press, 2004), pp. 209–226. The title of Hardy's minor work, Life's Little Ironies (1894), a collection of short stories, has won acceptance as a ‘set phrase’. This may be the narrator's notation of the astronomer's inveterate mode of observation, or Swithin's own thought in ‘free indirect discourse’. See Michael Toolan, Narrative: A Critical Linguistic Introduction 2nd Ed. (London: Routledge, 2001), p. 130. F. de Saussure, Course in General Linguistics, trans. W. Baskin (New York: Philosophical Library, 1959), p. 166. However, Hardy does not wish to be ‘crudely’ allegorical (with names which desert realism of presentation): ‘Cleeve’ is also a local (West Country) place-name (as in [e.g.] Cleeve Abbey in Somerset). This refers to the phenomenon of the planet's shadow falling on the surface of the sun. Jacques Derrida, Points: Interviews 1974–1994, trans. Peggy Kamuf et al., Ed. Elizabeth Weber (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1995). ‘Le silence éternel de ces espaces infinis m'effraie’, in the Pensées (posthumously published in 1670), now read off as an infidel voice which Pascal intended to combat: see [e.g.] Dictionnaire des Citations Françaises, ed. Robert Carlier, Jean-Louis Lalanne, Pierre Josserand and Samuel S. De Sacy (Paris: Larousse, 2001), p. 411. See Michael Toolan, Narrative, pp. 43–48. Simon During claims in Foucault and Literature: Towards a Genealogy of Writing (London: Routledge, 1992), that ‘not very convincingly, Foucault argues that “authors” come into historical being only when writing is able to be censored, when an individual can, potentially at least, be punished for their writing’ (p. 124). In fact ‘Hardy’, already well used to a critical abuse which went so far as to suggest the necessity for censorship or legal intervention, became more provocative, even ‘getting his retaliation in first’, as if constituting himself as author with reference to the orthodoxies he ‘affronted’. As Maurice Blanchot put it, in what constitutes a blow ‘for’ ‘bio-graphy’, ‘writing changes us. We do not write according to who we are; we are according to what we write’: cited in Andy Stafford, Roland Barthes, Phenomenon and Myth: An Intellectual Biography (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1998), p. 151. The situation resulted from their being surprised by Viviette's brother Louis Glanville's precipitate arrival at Welland House on a wet night. See Mieke Bal, Narratology: Introduction to the Theory of Narrative (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1985), p. 61. As Freud puts it in his essay in ‘The Uncanny’ (1919), ‘the uncanny is that class of the frightening which leads back to what is known of old and long familiar’, Standard Edition, ed. Strachey XVII (London: Vintage, 2001), p. 220. See Nicholas Royle, The Uncanny (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2003), e.g. pp. 172–186. See Hugh J. Silverman, Inscriptions (Evanston, Illinois: Northwestern University Press, 1997), pp. 328–32. Hardy probably has the ancient Greek concept of male beauty as advanced by archaeologist and art historian Johann Joachim Winkelmann (1717–1768) in mind. Winkelmann's ‘manly ideal’, described as ‘forbiddingly abstract’, is ‘overdetermined’ here by a quality Swithin derives from his chosen pursuit, but his boyish petulance when his discovery is forestalled contrasts with the outward and visible ‘grace’ which Winkelmann yokes to a sense of (inner) virtue(s). See David Glover and Cora Kaplan, Genders (London: Routledge, 2000), p. 60. Cf. Stéphane Mallarmé, ‘Un coup de dés jamais n'abolira le hasard’ (1897). The Bible (O.T.): Deuteronomy 32:35. Roland Barthes, A Barthes Reader, ed. Susan Sontag (London: Fontana Press, 1989), p. 187; ‘L’écrivain retrouve le monde, un monde étrange d'ailleurs, puisque la littérature le représente comme une question, jamais, en définitive, comme une réponse': Barthes, Essais Critiques (Paris: Éditions du Seuil, 1964), p. 149. Hardy assigned Two on a Tower to a ‘Romance and Fantasy’ sub-genre in a late foray into taxonomic tidying-up for the collected (‘Wessex’) edition of the novels in 1912. The term is Émile Durkheim's, developed in his study of Suicide (1897), to express the individual's sense of alienation from society's regulatory norms. Cf. Hardy's use of the Latin title ‘Sine Prole’ for a poem about his own lack of offspring published in the collection Human Shows, Far Phantasies, Songs, and Trifles (1925). This phrase, which accompanied Viviette's command to the effect that he should leave her temporarily when her love for him is first known, turned out to be an unintentionally apt anticipation of the outcome of the affair (Chapter 14). ‘Sons’ is suggestively gender-specific here. We may object to ‘man’ or ‘men’ deployed as a quasi-inclusive point of reference, but we are used (if not reconciled) to this. The choice of this particular Psalm, recast as a hymn, is an essential choice here, much to be preferred to the alternative [‘Onward Christian Soldiers’], used in Sally Shuttleworth's informative ‘Penguin’ edition of the novel in 1999. The basis of the choice of text lies in differences between the version serialised in the Atlantic Monthly and the three-volume ‘version’ published in Britain, both in 1882. See Colin MacCabe, James Joyce and the Revolution of the Word, 2nd ed. (Basingstoke: Palgrave, 2003), p. 18. Raymond Williams, The English Novel: From Dickens to Lawrence London: Chatto and Windus, 1970), p. 156. See J. Laplanche and J.B. Pontalis, The Language of Psychoanalysis (London: Karnac Books, 1988); the phenomenon is one in which ‘experiences, impressions and memory-traces may be revised at a later date to fit in with fresh experiences or with a new stage of development’ (p. 111). The invocation of the comet may have been based on Hardy's response to the appearance of ‘Tebbut's comet’ on 25 June 1881, as seen from his recently occupied home in Wimborne. See Paul Turner, The Life of Thomas Hardy: A Critical Biography (Oxford: Blackwell, 1998), p. 82 For Hardy's ‘Frankensteining’ of Romantic topoi see Kevin Z. Moore's The Descent of the Imagination (New York: New York University Press, 1990), a wildly erudite but suggestive work which deals with the later Hardy novels in a sophisticated, ‘Barthesian’ register. There is a problem with the precise significance of the word for Pascal: see Michael Moriarty, Early Modern French Thought: The Age of Suspicion (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2003), p. 128. The narrator's sense of Viviette's ‘plenitude’ here (it is clearly ‘men’ who are ‘lacking’ by comparison), is a reminder of the paradoxicalities of prejudice enunciated by Toril Moi in ‘Patriarchal Thought and the Drive for Knowledge (1988)’, in: What is a Woman? And Other Essays (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1999): p. 357. Arnold's ‘Dover Beach’ was written in the summer of 1851 after his marriage to Frances Wightman, as a honeymoon-poem: ‘his accounts for 19–30 June include the entry “Journey to Dover and back – £9.9.0”’; in terms of creative currency we might say that Hardy seems to have got his money's worth. See Matthew Arnold [Selection of the Poems], ed. Miriam Allott (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1995), p. 92. Slavoj Žižek discusses this paradoxicality in Interrogating the Real, ed. and trans. Rex Butler and Scott Stephens (London: Continuum, 2006), p. 68. Hardy's work may also be read as constituting a commentary on Jane Austen's paean to womanly love in Persuasion (1818) expressed by sorely tried Anne Elliot in Chapter 23: ‘we certainly do not forget you, as soon as you forget us . . . you have always a profession, pursuits . . . to take you back into the world’ &c., in (e.g.) Jane Austen, Persuasion (London: Penguin, 2006), p. 274. See Millgate, Thomas Hardy: A Biography Revisited, p. 492. An anonymous reviewer of Tess of the D'Urbervilles (Athenaeum, 9 January 1892), opens with the thought that ‘Prof. Huxley once compared life to a game of chess played by man [sic] against an enemy, invisible, relentless, wresting every error and every accident to his own advantage’. Probably Hardy himself already knew of this passage. See Thomas Hardy: The Critical Heritage, ed. R.G. Cox, (London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1970), p. 183. Derrida, Aporias, p. 13. Hardy knew the Shakespeare play well, citing it in Chapter 5, and deploying its sense of the ironies of love in Tess of the D'Urbervilles (1891). At such points Hardy illustrates Barthes' claim for Proust in his essay on ‘The Death of the Author’ to the effect that ‘instead of putting his life into a novel, as is so often maintained, he made of his own life a work for which his own book was the model’, in: Image Music Text, ed. and trans Stephen Heath (London: Fontana, 1984), p. 144. Recalling debates from Kant to Derrida about what is ‘inside or outside’ a work of art, with respect to its ‘frame’; see (e.g.) David Carroll, Paraesthetics: Foucault, Lyotard, Derrida (London: Methuen, 1987), p. 138. Kant refers to ‘those things which do not belong to the complete representation of the object internally as elements, but only externally as complements’, in the Critique of Judgement: cited in the essay by Irene E. Harvey, ‘Derrida, Kant and the Performance of Parergonality’, in Derrida and Deconstruction, ed. Hugh J. Silverman (London: Routledge, 1989), p. 59. Barthes: ‘the author performs a function . . .’ (A Barthes Reader p. 186); see note 9 and discussion in Foucault's ‘What is an Author?’ as reprinted in Textual Strategies: Perspectives in Post-Structuralist Criticism, ed. Josué V. Harari (London: Methuen and Co., 1980), p. 143. The essay appears in a different (earlier) form in Language, Counter-Memory, Practice, pp. 113–138. This work, and the essay, is listed in Textual Strategies (p. 432), and the difference in versions is discussed in Josué V. Harari's ‘Introduction’, p. 43. The first version of Foucault's essay originally appeared in the Bulletin de la Société française de la Philosophie, 63, No.3 (1969), 73–104. But he seems to argue that even Barthes' sophisticated notion of the primacy of writing ‘runs the risk of maintaining the author's privileges under the protection of writing's a priori status’, in ‘What is an Author?’ as reprinted in Textual Strategies: Perspectives in Post-Structuralist Criticism, ed. Josué V. Harari (London: Methuen and Co., 1980), p. 145. Foucault, ‘What is an Author?’ as reproduced in Language, Counter-Memory, Practice, p. 137. As Derrida puts it in an interview, ‘from the perspective of dissemination, I would not say there are no authors, but whoever bears the name “author”, to whom the legitimate status of author is accorded, is someone who is himself determined by the text, and is situated in the text or by the text’: see French Philosophers in Conversation, ed. Raoul Mortley (London: Routledge, 1991), p. 98. Foucault is formally opposed to the Derridean emphasis on ‘textuality’, but in pursuing the idea that ‘the author is the ideological figure by which one marks the manner in which we fear the proliferation of meaning’ (in ‘What is an Author?’ as reprinted in Textual Strategies: Perspectives in Post-Structuralist Criticism, p. 159), a similarity with respect to Barthes and Derrida's treatment of the author-figure or -function is suggested. Derrida, Aporias, 24; or Derrida, ‘Apories: Mourir-s'attendre aux limites de la vérité’, in Le Passage des Frontières: Autour du Travail de Jacques Derrida (Paris: Éditions Galilée, 1994), p. 318. Such quasi-authorial ‘moves’ also remind one of Bakhtin's claim to the effect that ‘the author is profoundly active but this action takes on a specific dialogic character’: cited in Seán Burke, The Death and Return of the Author: Criticism and Subjectivity in Barthes, Foucault and Derrida 2nd Ed. (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1998), p. 49. Shelley: Prometheus Unbound (1820), 1. 628: Poetical Works, ed. Thomas Hutchinson (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1971), p. 222. Hardy referred to Shelley (in the fustian pages of The Life) as ‘our most marvellous lyrist’, telling his friend Mrs. Henniker he would have liked to meet him ‘not only for his unearthly, weird, wild appearance and genius, but for his genuineness, earnestness, and enthusiasms on behalf of the oppressed’: see Collected Letters of Thomas Hardy II, ed. Michael Millgate and R.L. Purdy (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1980), p. 144.",Art history | Biography | Classics | History | Law | Philosophy | Political science | Scholarship | Sociology | Theology | Wife,https://openalex.org/W2080652729,1.0,,OpenAlex,9
10.1080/09502360903361626,Thinking intermittency†,Andrew Gibson,,2009,2009-12-01,Textual Practice,,article,en,False,"Click to increase image sizeClick to decrease image size Notes †This essay is dedicated to the memory of Guy Lardreau, 1947–2008. It is a brief, general, and simplified early version of one argument in my Logics of Intermittency: The Anti-Schematics of Historical Reason in Contemporary French Philosophy (in preparation for Edinburgh University Press). Save where indicated, all translations are my own. Guy Lardreau, Fictions philosophiques et science-fiction (Paris: Actes Sud, 1988), p. 71. Bensaid characterizes Badiou's and Rancière's concept of truth, politics, and the subject as ‘intermittent’, if to some extent critically. See ‘Alain Badiou et le miracle de l’événement' in Résistances: Essai de taupologie générale (Paris: Fayard, 2001), pp. 143–170, 154–155. The larger outline of my own Levinasian case in Postmodernity, Ethics and the Novel: From Leavis to Levinas (London: Routledge, 1999) now seems open to question, if not a great deal of its detail. Those like Simon Critchley and myself who argued for a Levinasian ethics in the mode of ‘atheist transcendence’ failed to recognize that, without the theological sanction, Levinas's ethics simply falls apart. For Critchley's argument, see ‘Il y a – Holding Levinas's Hand to Blanchot's Fire’ in Carolyn Bailey Gill (ed.), Maurice Blanchot: The Demand of Writing (London: Routledge, 1996), pp. 108–122. For my own recent position, see ‘Ethics’ in Michael Groden, Martin Kreiswirth, and Imre Szeman (eds.), The Johns Hopkins Guide to Literary Theory and Criticism (Baltimore and London: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2005), pp. 287–295; and Beckett and Badiou: The Pathos of Intermittency (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2006). Obviously enough, the essay was written before the present financial crisis confirmed one at least of its assumptions. However, the culture of plenitude is not yet by any means necessarily at risk. Whether profound intellectual shifts begin to take place will depend on how the situation develops, and how compelling the logic of ‘management’ appears to remain. Jacques Lacan, Seminar Book VII, The Ethics of Psychoanalysis 1959–60, Jacques-Alain Miller (ed.), trans. with notes by Dennis Porter (London: Routledge, 1999), p. 200. Ibid., p. 219. Ibid., p. 261. Ibid., pp. 194, 201. Ibid., p. 180. One good example of this ‘double logic’ would be the Stern Report on climate change, which asserted that the avoidance of catastrophe is smoothly compatible with apparently unlimited economic growth. What is unimaginable within the terms of the Report is that a priority other than ‘growth’ might conceivably come to preoccupy a significant number of contemporary minds. ‘D'o[ugrave] je parie sur l’événement', in Lardeau's phrase. Guy Lardeau, La Veracité (Paris: Verdier, 1993), p. 314. The Report's conception of catastrophe requires Benjamin's as its corrective. Françoise Proust, De la résistance (Paris: Cerf, 1997), p. 103. This paragraph is constructed as a ‘cynegetics of semblance’; on which important concept, see Christian Jambet and Guy Lardreau, L'Ange (Paris: Grasset & Fasquelle, 1976), pp. 17–41. The chapter in question was written by Lardreau. For a relevant and important account of the politics of contemporary jouissance, see Slavov Žižek, ‘The Politics of Jouissance’, Lacanian Ink 24/25 (Winter/Spring, 2005), pp. 126–135. In ‘L'inadmissible’, Jacques Rancière exactly captures the spirit of the privileged enclave by way of an analogy with an Imperial Rome growing ever more efficient at banishing both the thought and the reality of those denied access to its wealth and splendour. See Aux bords du politique (Paris: La Fabrique, 1998), pp. 128–147, especially at pp. 136–137. It is by no means insignificant for the analogy that the Rome of ‘L'inadmissible’ has properly incorporated its own plebeians. For an account of Badiou on this theme, see Beckett and Badiou, pp. 76–79. As in Very Little…Almost Nothing: Death, Philosophy, Literature (London: Routledge, 1997).

For Proust's account of practical reason as an experimental production of the real that discovers its principles with each specific new case, see for example ‘Introduction’, Théorie et pratique, pp. 5–40, 5–8. The Analytic of the Sublime does not develop a conception of a historical sublime along with the sublime in nature.

See Proust, L'Histoire à contretemps, passim, for instance at p. 10. Walter Benjamin, Passagen-Werk, Gesammelte Schriften (Frankfurt am Main: Suhrkamp, 1980), Vol V, pp. 490–491; quoted in Peter Osborne, ‘Small-Scale Victories, Large-Scale Defeats: Walter Benjamin's Politics of Time’ in Andrew Benjamin and Peter Osborne (eds.), Walter Benjamin's Philosophy: Destruction and Experience (London: Routledge, 1994), pp. 59–109 (p. 59). Ibid. Andrew Benjamin and Peter Osborne, ‘Introduction’ in Benjamin and Osborne (eds.), Walter Benjamin's Philosophy: Destruction and Experience, pp. x–xiii (p. x). This discussion avoids the Benjaminian concept of messianism. But Howard Caygill is surely right to think of Benjamin's messianism per se as an archaic vestige that ‘signifies the proximity of a lapse into dogmatism’. See Walter Benjamin: The Colour of Experience (London: Routledge. 1998), pp. 149–152, especially at p. 149. As such, messianism functions as a release from Benjaminian ‘saturnine melancholia’, as opposed of course to ‘left melancholia’, which he excoriated; on which distinction, see Max Pensky, Melancholy Dialectics: Walter Benjamin and the Play of Mourning (Amherst: University of Massachusetts Press, 1993), p. 14. For myself as for Badiou, any thought of the event will everywhere proceed according to the secular presumption. Giorgio Agamben, Homo Sacer: Sovereign Power and Bare Life, trans. Daniel Heller-Roazen (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1998). Agamben is quoting from G. Burdeau, Traité de science politique (Paris: Librairie générale du droit et de jurisprudence, 1984), Vol 4, p. 173. Ibid., p. 142. Ibid., pp. 12, 175. Cf. Coetzee's audacious recent declaration that our attitude to animals is an indication of how little we have escaped the shadow of Auschwitz. It bears witness to the persistence of a murderously exclusionary principle of thought which may in turn concern Africans, Jews, and animals. See Elizabeth Costello (London: Vintage, 2004), passim. Agamben, Homo Sacer, p. 180. For Benjamin's distinction, see ‘Critique of Violence’ in Marcus Bullock and Michael W. Jennings (eds.), Selected Writings Vol 1, 1913–1926 (Cambridge, MA, and London: Harvard University Press, 2004), pp. 236–252, passim. Antonio Negri, Il potere costituente: Saggio sulle alternative del moderno (Milan: SugarCo, 1992), p. 31; quoted in Agamben, Homo Sacer, p. 43. Ibid., p. 150. Ibid. I have capitalized in ‘Law’ to emphasize the Agamben/Kafka relation proposed here. Ibid., p. 51. Orwell grasps it, too. It is now possible to see that this, in fact, is the stark lesson of 1984, not any historically specific and limited critique of totalitarianism. See Proust, L'Histoire à contretemps, p. 97. Franz Kafka, Der Proceß, Malcolm Pasley (ed.) (Frankfurt a. M.: S. Fischer Verlag, 1990), p. 11. The word literally signifies a ‘State of law’ or, better, ‘State of rights’; a State in which citizens share civil liberties and are protected from any arbitrary exercise of State power, as contrasted with a police state. One might of course assume that a naive Josef K. has failed recognize a change in the regime of the State. But nothing in the novel indicates such a change, rather than an insidiously reversed vision of the Rechtstaat itself. Ibid., p. 303. This is Benjamin's point in the eighth of the ‘Theses on the Philosophy of History’, which, translated from Françoise Proust's translation, quite simply becomes ‘the “state of exception” in which we live is the rule’. Benjamin sees himself, however, to be addressing a ‘state of exception’ that is to some extent conscious of itself as such, or as a ‘state of emergency’. See Proust, L'Histoire à contretemps, p. 10; and Benjamin, ‘Theses on the Philosophy of History’, Illuminations, pp. 255–266 (p. 259). See Lardeau and Jambet on the need to extend the concept of the axiom beyond the realm of mathematics to philosophy and history, L'Ange, p. 19: if the Real declares a limit to any given thought, the axiom decrees its regularities. On the proposal and resistance to it, see http://www.independent.co.uk/news/ world/europe/france-and-spain-block-asylum-camp-plan-535311.html By no means all the examples are ‘highbrow’. There have been some powerful indictments of the logic of contemporary plenitude in popular fiction. See for example some of the late work of J. G. Ballard, or the recent work of John Le Carré, notably The Constant Gardener, The Mission Song and A Most Wanted Man. For which see Lardreau, La Veracité. ‘Negative philosophy’ is not nihilism and should not be confused with it. Note also the relevance of Lardreau's argument that Deleuze is precisely the right philosopher for the culture of plenitude, and that it is no accident that he should be so popular within it. See L'exercice différé de la philosophie: [Agrave] l‘occasion de Deleuze (Paris: Verdier, 1999). Cf. also my brief discussion of Jambet's treatment of the concept of the ‘imaginal world’ in esoteric Islam. See ‘On Not Being Forgivable: Four Meditations on Europe, Islam and the “New World Order”’ in Holly Campbell and Marian Eide (ed.), Forgiveness (forthcoming South Central Review); accessible at eprints.rhul.ac.uk/255. See Judith Balso, ‘Être present au present: L'hypothèse communiste possible pour la philosophie, nom impossible pour la politique?’ (presentation at the conference ‘On the Idea of Communism’, Birkbeck College, University of London, March 19–21, 2009, forthcoming in translation). Though the point, here, is equally aimed at those endless, melancholy-inducing reproaches to melancholy from the left, founded as they are on the presumption of a saving value to positive action and immediate readiness which one might have thought history had sufficiently blown to bits by now; except, of course, that what is at stake here is not really history or progress, but the psychic reassurance of the political subject. That the essay ends with a key Coetzeean word is as deliberate as the fact that it ends with the first-person plural. ‘Care and gravity’ do not exclude laughter, may even be inseparable from it.

Much less has been said about the more personal modes of discourse that have often characterized exchanges between twentieth century philosophers. In the case of Bataille, Blanchot, Deleuze, Foucault, and Klossowski, the exchanges that occur between them may be characterized as both intellectual and personal. One of the common denominators uniting the five figures in question is the College of Sociology, formed in March of 1937 by Bataille, Michel Leiris, and Roger Caillois. In virtually all of the possible permutations, these five philosophical figures engage in a discourse located in the margins of critical writing, that of the encomium of praise. Although Derrida's Politiques de l'amitié examines the concept of friendship, the primary goal of his work was not to legitimate eulogy between philosophers as a serious mode of discourse. Kaufman draws upon Derrida's seminal text; the object of her analysis, however, diverges from Derrida's concern with the political aspects of friendship. Kaufman sets out to analyze the articulations of the encomium at its points of greatest intensity in order to demonstrate the symbolic value of these exchanges and ultimately, to mount a defense of their form.",Art | Epistemology | Friendship | Law | Linguistics | Literature | Michel foucault | Object (grammar) | Philosophy | Political science | Politics | Praise | Psychoanalysis | Psychology | Social science | Sociology,https://openalex.org/W2064605465,0.0,,OpenAlex,9

Il serait question d’une sorte d’« anéantissement de soi », consenti par l’artiste, en vue de la création d’histoires complètes à portée universelle. Or, l’étrangeté de l’écriture de Kafka ne se limite pas à cette simple substitution de la troisième personne à la première personne du singulier ; elle ressort du fait que ces récits, tels que Le Verdict, Le Procès, et La Métamorphose, installent à l’intérieur d’eux-mêmes une logique d’écartement qui finit par brouiller le je et le il, le singulier et le collectif : « Il [Kafka] écrit des récits où il est question d’êtres dont l’histoire n’appartient qu’à eux, mais en même temps il n’est question que de Kafka et de sa propre histoire qui n’appartient qu’à lui. Tout se passe comme si, plus il s’éloignait de lui-même, plus il devenait présent. Le récit de fiction met, à l’intérieur de celui qui écrit, une distance, un intervalle (fictif lui-même), sans lequel il ne pourrait s’exprimer1. » L’Arrêt de mort, selon le prière d’insérer de son édition originale, est l’histoire d’une jeune femme qui « n’a pas pu se résigner à mourir » : « Qu’arriverait-il si celui qui meurt ne s’abandonnait pas entièrement [End Page 993] à la mort ? Qu’est-il arrivé, en vérité, le jour où, pour la plus grande et la plus grave des raisons, quelqu’un qui était déjà entré dans la mort, soudain arrêta la mort2?» Ce sentiment aigu d’horreur et de soupçon, horreur d’être enterré vivant, et soupçon que « la mort n’est jamais assez mort », que c’est dans la hantise de la mort qu’on vit, est ce qu’Emmanuel Levinas dénomme en 1946, en évoquant l’esprit fondamental des contes fantastiques d’Edgar Poe, l’il y a. Le secret du fantastique de Poe, explique-t-il, se trouve dans « l’imminence d’un événement, dont on suit, impuissant, l’approche, seconde après seconde, toute issue étant fermée ; le personnage se trouve enfermé dans un tombeau, anéanti ; mais dans cet anéantissement, aux prises avec l’existence3 ». En ce sens, L’Arrêt de mort, comme ce prière d’insérer de 1948 semble le suggérer, pourrait être considéré comme une réécriture de « Ligeia ». Poe raconte, dans la première partie de sa célèbre nouvelle, la mort prématurée de la belle Ligeia, épouse placide et cultivée du narrateur, et dans la deuxième partie, un « hideux drame de la revivification » vécu par ce même narrateur dans la chambre mortuaire de sa nouvelle épouse devenue elle-même défunte, Lady Rowena. L’Arrêt de mort, divisé également en deux parties, chantonne la même angoisse de l’approche de la mort, à ceci près qu’il la cadence, la multiplie, et la prolonge à l’infini. Le récit de Blanchot n’est pas pour autant simplement une histoire personnelle d’amour et de visions étranges. Bien qu’il retienne des éléments fantastiques de Poe, le romantisme sombre de ce dernier se fond dans un mal historique qui, s’étendant de l’automne 1938 au début de la Deuxième Guerre mondiale, annonce déjà l’imminence de l’extermination et les visages anonymes des morts incendiés. « Ces événements me sont arrivés en 1938 », écrit le narrateur au début de l’histoire, « j’éprouve à en parler la plus grande gêne4. » « Ces événements...",Art | Humanities | Philosophy,https://openalex.org/W1999502910,0.0,,OpenAlex,9

It is thus all the more significant that he maintains a constant interest in the work of a rare few writers and poets, particularly, in the early 1970s, that of the Romanian Jewish poet Paul Celan, whose mother tongue was German. What is at stake in Levinas’s reading of Celan goes far beyond a simple commentary on this major oeuvre of post-war European literature. It aims at the heart of the relation between poetry and philosophy and of a frequently controversial interrogation in which important figures of modern Western philosophy participate. In the following remarks, the traces of this debate in Levinas’s writings, particularly in those relating to Judaism, will be delineated in view of a central motif: the question of place. Levinas’s rare writings on poetry configure the place and the non-place at the intersection—or rather at the locus of interaction—of history, philosophy, and poetry between Greek and Jew. A reflection on Emmanuel Levinas’s approach to poetry leads to a constellation of the following names: Levinas, Blanchot, Hölderlin, Celan. These four figures conjoined paratactically form a chiasm as to the relationship between the poem, the place, and the Jew. Levinas and Celan meet at the outer poles of this figure of thought, at extremities whose relation is illuminated by the other two names, Blanchot and Hölderlin, which both unite and separate them. At the center of the chiasm is a name that is not expressed explicitly, but which nevertheless [End Page 699] constitutes the axis of this poetico-philosophical constellation: Martin Heidegger. This chiasm will be deployed in terms of a central motif: the question of place, more particularly the conceptual pairs of exile and Heimat, errancy and rootedness, homelessness and dwelling, all considered in respect to the poem, to poetry. In his essay titled “Paul Celan. De l’être à l’autre” (Paul Celan: From Being to the Other), first published in La Revue des Belles Letters in 1972, shortly after the poet’s suicide, Emmanuel Levinas implicitly retrieves and illustrates a central idea formulated in his earlier essay “La Trace de l’Autre” (The Trace of the Other). In this essay, Levi-nas distinguishes between Greek and Jew via the opposition between Ulysses’ and Abraham’s respective relations to place. Presenting a stark dichotomy, Levinas writes: “To the myth of Ulysses returning to Ithaca, we wish to oppose the story of Abraham who leaves his fatherland forever for a yet unknown land” (1986, 348).1 Ulysses’ journey is directed towards the eventual return to his native land, his Heimat; for Levinas, this orientation signifies a turning in upon oneself and contrasts with Abraham’s departure, which is oriented solely towards a foreign destination, a territory that is, so far, nothing but a promise. Between Ulysses and Abraham, as envisaged by Levinas, the fundamental difference between Greek and Jew, between Homer and the Hebrew Bible is at stake. The Greek route remains that of Ulysses, whose protracted, adventure-laden journey through the world is in fact nothing other than a return to himself, to his native island—“complying with the Same, misapprehending the Other” 2—as opposed to “the Biblical movement of the Same towards the Other” (Levinas, 1996a, 51). The closure and totality re-established through the return homewards as final destination in the Greek experience contrast with the Jewish destination, which corresponds to an incessant movement towards the other. Levinas describes this movement, perhaps somewhat hyperbolically, as an indifference to land and soil: “Judaism has always been free with regard to place” (1990, 231).3 With this laudatory statement, Levinas seems to not only support the traditional idea of the Jew as the eternal wanderer, but also to affirm [End Page 700] exile as both a positive mode of existence and, metaphorically, as an ethical modality of thought opening towards a non-retrievable alterity.

Her awareness of her problematic position as author of a text on the represen tation of women in collective biographies leads her to question feminist criticism's approach to the past-particularly its emphasis on literary women-forcing the fe minist reader to consider feminism's selectivity and tendency to overlook or dismiss women who do not conform to certain expectations. Feminist criticism has, in a sense, been as selective as the authors of female prosopographies in determining who has 'made it' as awoman. Booth suggests that Virginia Woolf encouraged the trend of dis missing from history certain previously eminent women, a tendency which, the book argues, is continued by feminist critics today. In this respect, Booth's eminently read able and enjoyable narrative not only offers insight intomaterial largely overlooked by previous scholars, but also highlights the need for a new critical perspective that calls into question the process through which women have been defined and labelled, and the problems associated with portrayals of representative types-whether nineteenth century depictions of ideal Victorian womanhood, or more recent portrayals of early feminist heroines. How to Make it as a Woman is thus an important contribution to feminist studies, highlighting the fact that feminist criticism still has some way to go in terms of recovering lost women's voices from the past. UNIVERSITYOFWALES SWANSEA JESSICA COX The Poetics of Singularity: The Counter-Culturalist Turn inHeidegger, Derrida, Blan chot and the Later Gadamer. By TIMOTHY CLARK. (The Frontier of Theory) Edinburgh:EdinburghUniversity Press. 2005. xvi+ i86 pp. ?50. ISBN 0 7486-I929-I. The main aim of The Poetics of Singularity is to redraw the limits of critical reading and move away from the dominant 'culturalist turn' inmodern criticism. The prob lem is indeed acute, as Clark notes: 'Awriter who finds herself describable as, say, ""gay"", ""Iranian"" and ""Christian"" will have critics striving to explain all she writes in terms of the self-making of that identity' (p. I7). The critical bid to define identities with some kind of label, hyphenated or otherwise, often unwittingly undoes the act of authors being 'different' or 'unique'. Clark's analyses of Heidegger, Gadamer, Blan chot, and Derrida usefully point away out of this situation and take readers on an occasionally difficult but always rewarding journey. His link toArendt's concept of 'natality' is innovative inasmuch as this ties the literary into the human in away that does not lapse back into a simple humanism; we read texts for the first time whenever we read them, and limiting them purely to contextual indicators (whether authorial, historical, or cultural) misses the power of literature to awaken a new sense of reality. This sense of looking at the world with fresh eyes is clearly indicated by Clark's readings of the four theorists. He treats their texts delicately, and teases out their sin gular elements while teasing out their relevance to the development of his argument. It is a pleasant change to find readings of Heidegger or Derrida that do not contain certain indicators ('post-structuralism', for example, appears only in counterpoint to Blanchot's hermeneutics), although this is perhaps taken too far by Clark. His brief rejection of Heidegger's nationalism is a case in point: 'the inherent logic of singular ization must lead to the reader's own rejection both of any lingering nationalism in Heidegger but also of studies of his thought that are too hasty to explicate it in terms of the cultural categories it thoroughly undermnines' (p. 6o). His intent is clear, and up to a point Heidegger's texts must be approached as 'texts' rather than, shall we say, 'works', but the imperative 'must' indicates too strenuous a rejection of contextualization. This leads to perhaps the most serious flaw in the book, although it is does not 1074 Reviews significantly affect the overall argument.

Bruns,,2007,2007-01-01,Fordham University Press eBooks,,book,en,False,"Marcel Duchamp once asked whether it is possible to make something that is not a work of art. This question returns over and over in modernist culture, where there are no longer any authoritative criteria for what can be identified (or excluded) as a work of art. As William Carlos Williams says, A poem can be made of anything,even newspaper clippings.At this point, art turns into philosophy, all art is now conceptual art, and the manifesto becomes the distinctive genre of modernism. This book takes seriously this transformation of art into philosophy, focusing upon the systematic interest that so many European philosophers take in modernism. Among the philosophers Gerald Bruns discusses are Theodor W. Adorno, Maurice Blanchot, Arthur Danto, Stanley Cavell, Hans-Georg Gadamer, Michel Foucault, Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari, Jacques Derrida, Jean-Franois Lyotard, Jean-Luc Nancy, Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe, and Emmanuel Levinas.As Bruns demonstrates, the difficulty of much modern and contemporary poetry can be summarized in the idea that a poem is made of words, not of any of the things that we use words to produce: meanings, concepts, propositions, narratives, or expressions of feeling. Many modernist poets have argued that in poetry language is no longer a form of mediation but a reality to be explored and experienced in its own right. But what sort of experience, philosophically, might this be? The problem of the materiality or hermetic character of poetic language inevitably leads to questions of how philosophy itself is to be written and what sort of communitydefines the work of art-or, for that matter, the work of philosophy.In this provocative study, Bruns answers that the culture of modernism is a kind of anarchist community, where the work of art is apt to be as much an event or experience-or, indeed, an alternative form of life-as a formal object. In modern writing, philosophy and poetry fold into one another.

Generally known as a critic of phenomenology who argued in favor of ethics, rather than ontology, as first philosophy, Levinas produced a considerable body of philosophical work, including most notably Totality and Infinity (1961) and Otherwise than Being (1974), as well as a series of texts devoted specifically to Judaism. The translation of Proper Names is noteworthy for making available to an English-speaking public a number of essays, all written during the most important period of Levinas's career (roughly speaking, from the late forties to the mid-seventies), that are more accessible than the strictly philosophical publications. These essays help to situate their author in relation to such figures as Martin Buber, Paul Celan, Jacques Derrida, Søren Kierkegaard, and Marcel Proust, but are equally informative when dealing with lesser known artists and thinkers such as Shmuel Josef Agnon, Jeanne Delhomme, Edmond Jabès, Jean Lacroix, Roger Laporte, Max Picard, Leo Van Breda, and Jean Wahl.

Beauvoir, as everybody knows, was to denounce in Le Deuxieme Sexe the oppression of women in patriarchy, but also, which is less well known, she was to expose in La Vieillesse the ways elderly people are badly treated in a society geared towards productivity and youth. Tidd also narrates Beauvoir's involvement with her significant Others, mainly Sartre and Nelson Algren, but also Claude Lanzmann, and Sylvie Le Bon. She relies, of course, on Beauvoir's autobiographies, but also on more recently published letters and diaries, as well as critical studies. Tidd discusses all of Beauvoir's major works and even some of her lectures, such as those she gave in Japan, summarizing the argument or the plot and highlighting themain ideas. She signals too what kind of reception some of the essays and novels had. Beauvoir emerges as a formidable figure, perhaps more of a philoso pher than a fiction writer, since Tidd puts the accent on her ideas. Tidd obviously respects Beauvoir, and this is reflected in the tactful handling of some of themore controversial aspects of her life.

Although byWarren Motte's own avowal this accessible volume isnot intended to provide a comprehensive survey of the extreme contemporain, it defies perennial pronouncements of the terminal crisis of the French novel. Concentrating on the Metropolitan French novel that is his area of expertise, and by taking a series of what he describes as 'soundings' (p. 10), Motte seeks to put the range and diversity of the French contemporary critical novel on display' (p. 33). While the descriptor critical' remains somewhat opaque, the opening chapter identifies a personal preference forwriters who situate themselves questioningly in relation to literary tradition and to the cultural and political challenges of the turn of the twenty-firstcentury. With their self-reflexivemetaliterary strategies and a concern for certain kinds ofmarginality (though questions of gender and sexuality tend to be elided), forMotte, 'they share a crucial will tomake French fiction new' (pp. 13-14).

None the less, Motte's analyses remind readers of the diverse critical perspectives which can still be brought to bear on the art of novel-writing, and of how close reading remains a potentially critical and palpably pleasurable practice.

As Zaia Alexander has recently noted, the lack of critical attention hitherto devoted to Primo Levi's activities as a translator, as well as to translations of his works, is indeed surprising ('Primo Levi and Translation', in The Cambridge Companion to Primo Levi, ed. by Robert S. C. Gordon (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2007), pp. 155-69 (p. 155)). Lina N. Insanas monograph analysing Levi's approaches to and theorization and practices of translation thus constitutes a long overdue contribution to the ever-growing field of Levi studies, and promises to MLR, 105.3, 2010 883 open up new avenues of research in this area. Indeed, itbegins with an overview of how and where translation figures in Levi's work and thought, inwhich she reveals its apparent ubiquity inhis essays, fiction, and testimonial work alike, and asserts its importance in facilitating not only linguistic but also ethical exploration. Providing a convincing catalogue of illustrative examples, she asserts that Levi's engagements with translation range from 'intra- and interlinguistic transmission to other,more anthropological, biological and mechanical forms of reproduction and transmission' (p. x), and shows in her detailed and meticulous analysis how ultimately, forLevi, translation functions as a metaphor forHolocaust witnessing' (p. 11), forwhich the source text is Auschwitz itself (p. 57). Given Levi's not inconsiderable activities as a translator and the frequency with which his writings evoke and narrativize processes of translation, it is therefore somewhat frustrating that Insana chooses to focus on only four case studies: Levi's recurring references to and rewritings of Samuel Taylor Coleridge's 'Rime of theAncient Mariner'; the presence ofDante's 'Canto di Ulisse' in his work; and Levi's translations of Jacob Presser's De nacht der Girondijnen and Franz Kafka's Der Prozefi.

But what can waiting signify when one no longer waits for something/someone to come in a determinable future or when the horizon of such a traditional form of waiting starts receding? This paper attempts to frame this problem within a “dialectical” reading of Beckett’s play Waiting for Godot , starting from the existential-temporal dimension of humanity’s Dasein as “destined-to-death,” which traces the limits of waiting with/for an end as the time of the always missed/deferred encounter with Godot, symbolizing the ultimate appointment with death. As the play unfolds, the main characters may be seen to approach, albeit unwittingly, the threshold of another, more objectless waiting: that of Derrida’s arrivant or waiting without (messianic) expectation in a future-to-come ( avenir ). Finally, after a detour via Blanchot’s own modes of waiting and, as a possible remedy, the form of negation known as forgetting ( Awaiting Oblivion ), it returns to the ultimate inescapability of waiting beyond the “end” of Beckett’s play and, following Abraham and Torok’s speculative endeavor to write a “Sixth Act” in order to put to rest the dramatic uncertainties of Hamlet , it attempts to imagine a “third act,” once the curtain has fallen on Beckett’s characters.",Philosophy,https://openalex.org/W2032220807,4.0,,OpenAlex,9

New York: Fordham University Press, 2016. 208 pp. Not every young scholar would venture to devote her first book to developing an entirely different theory of literature. Audrey Wasser is certainly not like every young scholar. In The Work of Difference, Wasser articulates an account of literary difference as a concept opposed to literary “newness,” the latter being the product of a “still regnant romanticism” (93) which “continues to hold sway over the way we read” (1). Wasser claims that we demand of works that they be new when we expect them to be internally consistent and autonomous on a formal level or to respond to, but negate, codified structures of possible linguistic expression. But such a demand overshadows the specific difference of what is new. “Newness has a particular history” (1), which Wasser traces, offering a deconstruction of its romantic roots, in chapters 1–3. In chapter 4, Wasser articulates her innovative literary theory (for several reasons discussed below, we should avoid calling the theory “new”), which resolves problems inherent in our concept of newness. In the book’s final chapters (5–7), Wasser applies her theory of difference, advancing compelling rhetorical readings of key modernist novels by Samuel Beckett, Marcel Proust, and Gertrude Stein. In the historical part of her project, Wasser defines two camps in 20th-century literary theory whose concepts of “newness” most directly influence current reading practices: New Criticism, on the one hand (Wasser almost exclusively focuses on Cleanth Brooks), whose legacy is formalist and intrinsic criticism, and the proto-Derridean theory of Maurice Blanchot, on the other. According to Wasser, Brooks prioritizes newness by emphasizing the formal autonomy of any works of art: a work includes formal paradoxes and a multiplicity of metaphors, which its internal consistency as a linguistic unit reconciles in an absolutely unique way (49). For Blanchot, on the other hand, language is “an experience of perpetual self-erasure . . . the structure of the work is one of sacrifice: a sacrifice of the inspiration that gave rise to it . . . so that the work’s very determination is that of a distance from its origin” (66). Both authors demonstrate for Wasser the same problem inherent in using newness as a benchmark for judging literary works, since “what is lacking in both is a positive, genetic account of the difference between literary form and authorial intention, or between form and its causal context” (73, my italics). Neither can answer Wasser’s crucial question: “how can something arise from a given set of conditions and at the same time be different from them?” (68). Whereas Brooks winds up, despite himself, implicitly equating a work’s formal determination to some preceding authorial [End Page 349] intention, Blanchot likewise fails to account for difference with his notion of “negative determination,” which views the work as a representation precisely of (the impossibility of) its linguistic conditions, and which Wasser condemns as “an imposter for real difference” (68). In both Brooks and Blanchot, Wasser sees a “logic of reflection” operative which “demands that a work be grasped as a mirror-image of its conditions of creation” (5). She traces this logic to early German romanticism, and, in particular, to the “critical imperative” of literature theorized by Friedrich Schlegel (her exclusive reference point for German romanticism). Romanticism claimed that any particular work should ideally “[project] the idea of an absolute Work that would be capable of absorbing its own criticism, theorizing itself and reflecting on itself, and thus effectively excluding any supplemental discourse” (36). In this way, romanticism values in literature its ability “simultaneously to complete and incomplete [itself] with reflective commentary” (36). From the absolute independence and the self-negation of the romantic work of art stem Brooks’ and Blanchot’s theories, respectively. Wasser identifies the romantic concept of reflection as a response to Kantian critical philosophy: the concept of literary newness which fails to account for the difference of the new is intrinsically bound to the failure of the romantics—and of Brooks and...",Art | Art history | Biology | Deconstruction (building) | Ecology | Literary criticism | Literary theory | Literature | Modernism (music) | Philosophy | Rhetorical question | Romance | Romanticism | Sociology,https://openalex.org/W2806756293,0.0,,OpenAlex,9
10.1353/pmc.2002.0002,Practical Politics at the Limits of Community: The Cases of Affirmative Action and Welfare,Scott Michaelsen | Scott Cutler Shershow,,2002,2002-01-01,Postmodern Culture,,article,en,False,"Practical Politics at the Limits of Community: The Cases of Affirmative Action and Welfare Scott Michaelsen and Scott Cutler Shershow Abstract In the wake of a number of studies of the relationship between post-structuralism and the ""political,"" this article demonstrates how a post-structuralist Marxism can be applied to particular instances of politico-economic decision-making. Through an examination of U.S. court cases that address affirmative action and welfare, the authors reveal the limits of both ""left"" and ""right"" versions of these policies and show how the entire spectrum of conventional opinion unites around (and remains unable to escape) certain founding assumptions. In particular, the traditional conceptualizations of affirmative action and welfare reach their limit in the figures of mandated white supremacy and enforced economic inequality. The authors also suggest that it is precisely at these limits that another form of politics emerges--one influenced in particular by a broadly Marxian/Derridean trajectory and Jean-Luc Nancy's work on community. This form of politics involves what the authors call ""calculation in order to end calculation,"" by which all conventional notions of giving or sharing must be radically reconfigured at the limit of identity itself. Such a politics would produce an ""affirmative action"" policy not strictly affirmative of anything, not even ""diversity,"" a policy whose goal would be absolute deracialization; and a ""welfare"" policy no longer founded in exclusion and the preservation of scarcity, but re-conceived as an expenditure without reserve: an offering or sharing of well-being to an ""all"" that remains forever open.--sm and scs As soon as, through the movement of those forces tending toward a break, revolution appears as something possible, with a possibility that is not abstract, but historically and concretely determined, then in those moments revolution has taken place. —Maurice Blanchot We are left with a simple command, and an infinite responsibility. Be just with Justice. —Drucilla Cornell This essay attempts to confront perhaps the most obvious and yet the most difficult challenge of radical social critique: the question of the practical. Both of its authors have been interested for many years in various modes of deconstruction and post-Marxism, and we have attempted, in our separate ways, to expose the limits not only of the historical discourses of economy and anthropology, but even of some of the cherished concepts of contemporary left-wing thought. But our work on multiculturalism, political economy, and cultural studies has brought us to the limit of our own critiques. At this limit, how does one say “yes” to the affirmative? How can we, in the words of the famous Marxist injunction, “prove the truth, that is, the reality and power, the this-sidedness” of our thinking in practice (Marx and Engels 144)? We thus respond here to two challenges. The first concerns the general perception in many circles that poststructuralist thought is either a form of quietism with no political consequences or a reactionary practice that easily slides into the anti-Semitisms and fascisms of Nazi-era Heidegger and deMan. Much recent work in the tradition of poststructuralist Marxism, including our own, has been attacked on one or the other of these grounds. To some, the work seems merely theoretical and thus utterly impractical. To others, even more seriously, the work seems counterproductive in its relentless critique of seemingly promising possibilities for political thought and action. In other words, poststructuralist and post-Marxist modes of theory are perceived as merely alternating between a scholastic cataloguing of utopian (im)possibilities, and a categorical rejection of all down-to-earth, practical-progressive thought. A great deal has been written in recent years attempting to disprove these views. One might mention, among others, Michael Ryan’s Marxism and Deconstruction: A Critical Articulation (1982), Drucilla Cornell’s Beyond Accommodations (1991; new edition 1999), Geoff Bennington’s Legislations (1996), Richard Beardsworth’s Derrida and the Political (1996), Chantel Mouffe’s The Democratic Paradox (2000), and Derrida’s own many recent writings on politics, including, most famously, Specters of Marx (1994), and his response to the critics of that book in Ghostly Demarcations (Sprinker ed. 1999).

10.1353/crc.2018.0040,"""Bartleby the Scrivener"": An Allegory of Reading",Mássimo Verdicchio,,2018,2018-01-01,Canadian review of comparative literature,,article,en,False,"""Bartleby the Scrivener"":An Allegory of Reading Massimo Verdicchio Herman Melville's ""Bartleby the Scrivener: A Story of Wall Street"" has challenged many readers over the years with its title character's inscrutability and refusal to undertake any action with his categorical statement, ""I would prefer not to."" Unlike most stories that seem to generate interest solely with literary critics, Melville's story has attracted the attention of many philosophers who have been seduced by Bartleby's firm resistance and opposition to anything that the lawyer-narrator has asked him to do. However, these philosophers are not concerned with the story of Bartleby per se: who he is or what he did or did not do. Their only concern is with what Giorgio Agamben has called the ""formula"": ""I would prefer not to,""1 which they take as the starting point for developing their philosophical analysis. For Agamben, who has devoted another essay, ""Bartleby, or On Contingency,"" to the novella, the formula is an example of how authority, sovereignty, and law can be resisted passively and effectively. Other philosophers, such as Gilles Deleuze, believed that ""Bartleby is the new Christ or the brother to us all"" (90), a view also shared by Jacques Rancière. Slavoj Žižek added that ""Bartleby could not hurt a fly, which is what makes his presence so unbearable"" (385). Michel Foucault, Maurice Blanchot, George Bataille, Jean-Luc Nancy, Alan Badiou, and Jacques Derrida also deserve mention among the many philosophers, too many to be listed here, who have commented on Bartleby's strange case. Even Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri refer to Bartleby in Empire as a figure of ontological resistance to Empire. He is said to be a beautiful soul whose being ""in its [End Page 438] absolute purity hangs on the edge of an abyss"" (204). A similar reading comes from Peggy Kamuf who, under the aegis of Jacques Derrida, proposes an essay with the alluring title ""Bartleby, or Decision: A Note on Allegory."" At issue is the notion of the possibility or ""im-possibility"" of decision. Kamuf situates the ordeal of the experience of the im-possible, which for Derrida is another name for deconstruction, with the lawyer-narrator of the story, as a result of Bartleby's ""passive immobilism"" (35). The story of Bartleby can thus be understood as an allegory, but not in the common sense of a representation of ""abstract qualities,"" she claims, but as ""an allegorical configuration of the deconstructive analysis of the deciding subject"" (35). Literary critics have been more demanding of ""Bartleby."" Their interests are not limited to the formula, but extend to the entire narrative: plot, characters, narrative development, meaning, and so on. From this perspective, Bartleby does not satisfy because the story does not provide the reader with all the elements that are usually found in typical short stories or novellas. We know very little of Bartleby, where he came from, his family, his hopes, or his desires. The reader's frustration is similar to that of the lawyer in the story, who asks: ""In mercy's name, who is he?"" (""Bartleby"" 124). Attempts over the years to answer this question have been many, and not very satisfactory. Critics are like the lawyer-narrator in the story who tries to befriend Bartleby and to help him as much as he humanly can, but with no results. Critics have identified Bartleby as everything from a Christ figure to a new Ishmael, or to an artist figure reminiscent of Kafka's Hunger Artist. Suffice it to say that these readings do not exhaust all interpretive possibilities, and none of them provide a satisfactory enough answer not to warrant further readings.2 This is also the case with a recent reading by Nicholas Royle, who proposes a new theory of literature as ""veering,"" defined as ""a sort of pivot for thinking about literature and its relation to the world"" (168). For Royle, the story of Bartleby is ""about the essential relation between writing and law, and between law and literature"" (158), and, more specifically, it is a story about ""justice, homelessness and vagrancy"" (158), or about ""veering.""

The first is an expression of continental Europe, the second is Franco-Algerian, nourished by Jewish culture. Yet, for example, both take the biblical lesson seriously.

Derrida is more inclined, with Nietzsche and, in some ways, with Marx and Freud, to reversals, assonances, paradox.

10.1215/0041462x-7299895,Narratives of Nothing in Twentieth-Century Literature by Meghan Vicks,Maurizia Boscagli,,2018,2018-12-01,Twentieth Century Literature,,article,en,False,"“What is it about the human condition that allows us to conceive of and question nothing itself, and to create various signifiers of nothing, such as zero? . . . Does nothing exist: or is existence ontologically antithetical to nothing?” (1). With these questions, Meghan Vicks opens her book Narratives of Nothing in Twentieth-Century Literature. Vicks makes clear from the beginning that she is not talking of negativity, negation, or nihilism: by pursuing the question of nothing and of its inscription in twentieth-century textualities, she immediately positions her discussion in one specific theoretical camp, Heideggerian philosophy and Derridean deconstruction, marginally filtered through the discourses of the neurosciences and of narrative theory. Vicks’s focus, carefully elaborated through the informed explications of the philosophies that sustain her perspective and through intelligent and exhaustive analyses of literary texts, is nothing’s relation to narrative and nothing as “essential to the creation of narrative.” Nothing is ineffable, and yet it is readable and perceptible as the presence of absence in the literary examples Vicks discusses, from Maxim Gogol and Herman Melville to Vladimir Nabokov, Samuel Beckett, and Viktor Pelevin. Nothing, as a foundational void, is understood as immanent. Vicks maintains, nothing becomes crucial in modernity: “Nothing becomes the transcendental signifier in the 20th century” (173). Like Jacques Lacan’s phallus, key to a philosopher she never mentions, nothing is the necessarily inaccessible, ungraspable center around which everything gravitates and from which the entire order of reality and meaning derives.The introduction and first chapter are dedicated to the noteworthy reconstruction of the history of nothing, from Odysseus’s self-presentation as outis (no one or no man) in Homer’s Odyssey, to the khora in Plato’s Timaeus, “the blank in the system that allows for . . . identity to take place” (5). Later, the khora is taken up by both Jacques Derrida and Julia Kristeva in their work. While Odysseus’s outis becomes the source of “the modern novel and by proxy, modern subjectivity” (7), the khora as “receptacle, nurse, or mother” (6) is the trait d’union that, in chapter 1, leads Vicks to discuss Martin Heidegger, Jean-Paul Sartre, and Derrida as the most prominent theorists of nothing in the twentieth century. The chapter opens with a fascinating history of zero as a mathematical concept and sign from the Babylonians to the Greeks (Vicks notes Aristotle’s dismissal of infinity and void), to India and the Arab world, to Christian Europe’s diffidence about adopting the sign 0 until the fourteenth century, when, in Italy, double entry bookkeeping was adopted: “If one’s account is balanced, the difference is 0” (35). The section on Heidegger’s Dasein and on Sartre’s nothingness hinges on their different articulation of the relationship between the human being and nothing. The texts examined here are Heidegger’s lecture “What is Metaphysics?” (1929) and Sartre’s Being and Nothingness (1943). While Dasein, human existence, “only occurs by being held out in the nothing” (35), so that human beings are compelled “to transcend the whole of being and thereby come into selfhood,” Sartre proposes an anti-Hegelian, anti-dialectical view of this articulation. Nothingness and being are not opposites; rather, nothingness is brought into the world by human beings themselves. Sartre’s idea of nihilation, in Vicks’s reading, refers to Nietzsche’s idea of forgetfulness and perspectivism in the essay “On Truth and Lies in a Nonmoral Sense” (1873). In turn, Nietzsche opens the path to the investigation of Derrida, the most important philosophical voice in the book.At this point, having established the theoretical foundations of her argument, Vicks enunciates her central axiom: the essential relation between nothing and narrative (47). Narrative is understood as “any meaning-making structure” that depends on nothing. In order to elaborate on the emergence and the source of narrative, Vicks invokes three unexpected bedfellows: Sartre, Fredric Jameson of The Political Unconscious (1981), and neuroscience (48). Here the question of Nietzschean forgetfulness and perspectivism, so relevant for postmodernism and its post-grand-narratives relativism, becomes the stepping stone toward Derrida’s essay “Structure, Sign, and Play in the Discourse of the Human Sciences” (1966). The essay affirms, in Vicks’s words, that “the absence of the transcendental signified extends the domain of interplay of signification ad infinitum” (50). She carries the concept of Derridean play over into Mikhail Bakhtin’s theory of the carnivalesque element of language as “cut loose from the rigidity of dominant modes of discourse, from the eternal stability of the transcendental signified” (45). The world of carnival, set free from official discourse and hierarchy, becomes a form of nothingness, endlessly at play. The grafting of Bakhtin’s carnival onto Derrida’s play as figurations of nothing, a nothing capable of generating a whole narrative system, takes Vicks to Julia Kristeva and her theorization of poetic language as centered (or decentered) on the khora, the void, the receptacle that Kristeva envisions as maternal, an otherness akin to nothing and its iconoclastic productivity.Once Vicks’s theoretical frame has been laid out, the book proceeds to examine different figurations of nothing in modern fiction. Each of the five solidly researched chapters opens with the presentation of the most relevant criticism of the specific texts examined, with Vicks offering an exhaustive, reasoned bibliography on the authors she studies. Very often her explications and close readings of the fiction are the most striking and memorable elements of the book. Always guided by her theoretical and critical expertise, she embarks on brilliant and often original analyses of the texts she has chosen. She shows how Nikolai Gogol’s story “The Overcoat” and Herman Melville’s novella Bartleby the Scrivener precede the more extreme images of nothing of the twentieth century. The stories, both centered on language or, better, on the refusal of language, are constructed around a void that Vicks, following Giorgio Agamben, considers the locus of potentiality. Both Akaki Akakievich and Bartleby, caught in their “silence, inaction, colorlessness” (61), are still capable of generating narrative for others, such as the lawyer in the case of Bartleby.The work of Vladimir Nabokov, the focus of chapter 3, seems to best express the author’s understanding of nothing as the transcendental signifier. The readings of Nabokov’s criticism and fiction—for instance, “Signs and Symbols” (1948), The Real Life of Sebastian Knight (1941), Pale Fire (1962), Transparent Things (1972), and Look at the Harlequins (1974), rather than the inevitable Lolita (1955)—trace the process that “construct[s] the knowable world” (100). The world, as much as meaning, language, and the subject, emerge not in contrast to but from nothing, a space where all these elements are always already virtually contained: “It is the gap in the system, and the non-existence of absolute significance that enables the proliferation of meaning-making patterns. . . . This is an idea that touches a deep chord in various theories concerning systems that construct the knowable world.” As in the case of zero in modern mathematics, or of the nothing on which Dasein is founded, or of the infinite play of signifiers in Nabokov’s fiction, reality can only appear in quotations marks: nothing, on which reality is founded, remains inaccessible and can only be glimpsed at through its signifiers. Reality laid bare cannot be reached, only inferred: “Reality without quotation marks is non-existent. . . . There is only ‘reality,’ which is generated through some kind of reflection, contemplation, imagination, subjectivity, fictionalizing” (90).Chapter 4, “Samuel Beckett, Immanence, Language, Nothing,” together with the chapter on Melville, is of special interest to scholars of Anglophone literature. In Beckett’s “aesthetic of lessness” in the novels Murphy (1938), Molloy (1951), and Malone Dies (1951), “the unnameable,” that is, reality without quotation marks, becomes fully unsignifiable, and language is reduced to a minimum “in a highly ambiguous and disconcerting discourse” (106). Beckett, affirms Vicks, reaches “an immanent plane,” the point where both narrative and being are laid bare. Here Gilles Deleuze’s “plane of immanence” is refunctioned as nothing. Once again, immanence, via Beckett and Deleuze, is not pitted against transcendence but, rather, is presented as an infinite and undifferentiated reality, a reservoir for potentiality. This is the territory where subject and object, life and death, can no longer be kept separate; similarly, Vicks notes, “the distinction between human and animal, animal and vegetable, organic and inorganic . . . does not exist” (114). All these binaries come to inhabit a magmatic terrain from which reality in quotation marks will emerge. In a particularly rich and thorough reading of Molloy, Vicks presents the protagonist as the anti-Joycean Ulysses, an impoverished version of Bloom. In Beckett’s text, James Joyce’s ebullient mastery of language, affirms Vicks, is streamlined to a semantic minimalism. We could add that the intermingling of separate categories such as subject/object, human/ nonhuman—an interconnection that has recently become the chief object of inquiry for both new materialism and environmental studies in Joyce’s text—is possible only as hallucination, as, for example, in the intoxicated and altered state of the characters in “Circe.”Not all moments of fusion between opposites are to be understood in terms of immanence: in the context of “Circe,” the melting of the self into the other, of masculinity into femininity, are the oneiric product of intoxication and hallucination. In Molloy, the plane of immanence and its melting of binary oppositions has become the normal experience for the Beckettian nonsubject. Still, as in the case of Akaki Akakievich and Bartleby before him, Molloy feels compelled to speak and to tell: as Vicks points out in one of the most salient passages of the book, “Molloy is the place of infinite nothing that languages” (126). Another moment of Ulysses comes to mind here, one that makes an interesting comparison with Beckett’s management of language, and that the book does not mention: the “Ithaca” episode in which the narrative assumes the question-answer format of Catholic catechism. The narrative voice, which Fredric Jameson interrogates so incisively in The Modernist Papers (2007), seems to be originating from nothing and from nowhere, and not from any specific human character or narrator. This comparison would have complicated the idea of Joyce’s “masterful control of language” (121) that Vicks invokes, or perhaps it could have revealed Beckett’s own mastery, rather than the absence of it, on his text. In any case, for Vicks nothing is never a sign of nihilism but, rather, “a plentiful void, pure potentiality of infinite being” (126).The final chapter, “Victor Pelevin’s Void and the Post-Soviet Condition,” is the most interesting and striking of the book. Here the question of nothing is, on the one hand, studied in its connection with “the postmodern condition” and postmodernism and, on the other, treated as part of a specific historical and political moment, that of post-Soviet Russia. For the first time history and culture emerge as part, albeit only part, of Vicks’s discussion, after having been, in the rest of the book, swept under the rug of a transhistorical and immanent view of language and philosophy. The title of Pelevin’s novel, Generation P, where “P” stands for Pepsi, has been translated into English as Homo Zapiens, an allusion to the modern Russian individual zapping through the newly available myriad of TV channels. The deep void of post-Soviet society is historicized as the void of consumerism: Russian culture is now besieged by commodities and emptied of any value and meaning, as, according to Pelevin, the decline of literary production and readership reveals. Under these conditions the literary work can only parody, if not simulate, the culture that produced it. Cultural void is dramatized by the void of the text, where “men are conglomerations of images and brands” (146). Pelevin’s work, “aware of the simulative nature of reality and the notion of a divine absurdity structuring existence” (137), centers on postmodern self-reflexivity. Vicks points out that his work illustrates three different types of void: that invoked by Western postmodernism, that of the experimentalism of the Russian artistic avant-gardes of the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, and, finally, that of Zen Buddhism. While the extremely interesting issue of Zen Buddhism is unfortunately not developed, we hear much more about a new brand of nothing, the capitalist “nihilistic nothing, rendering its subjects empty vessels through which to channel money (which of course, is another type of nothing), and reducing all meaning and truth to a consumer rating or a price-tag” (143–44). In this perverse version of a Buddhist perspective on nothing (one could also think of the Taoist mu, emptiness), the human subject does not feel at one with the universe, as a Zen version of nothing would prescribe. Rather, the subject becomes one with the commodity, while reality has been taken over by simulation, for instance compulsive TV-watching. Even more interesting and illuminating is the discussion of Russian avant-garde art, particularly conceptualism. Vitaly Komar and Aleksander Melamid’s SOTS-ART, Russia’s answer to Andy Warhol’s pop art, as well as Ilya Kabachov’s work, debunk the imagery of socialist realism by overexposing it and therefore simulating it. The void of these images is pitted by the avant-garde artist against a more optimistic view of nothing as capable of acting as a creative force.The originality of Vicks’s book lies in her choice to reflect on nothing, rather than taking up the better known critique of negativity or nihilism. In so doing, Vicks situates her analysis in a specific theoretical field: that of Heideggerian and Derridean philosophy, focused on ontology and openly antagonistic to the dialectic and to transcendence. At the same time, Vicks’s stress on language and narrative excludes any materialist reading of nothingness, that is, she leaves out the materialism that is built into the problem on which her entire discussion hinges: this is the question of how reality comes into being, on which Western philosophy has speculated since its beginning. The specificity of Vicks’s theoretical and methodological choice is both the strength and the weakness of her book. This becomes particularly evident in the chapter on Beckett. In order to explain “Beckett’s plane of immanence,” Vicks turns, briefly, to Deleuze and Spinoza, without mentioning a whole other tradition of Western philosophy that privileges a materialist view of immanence. This tradition takes us back to the pre-Socratic atomism of Democritus and Lucretius, to Spinoza, Vico, Marx, as well as to certain aspects of Heidegger’s thought, as Louis Althusser explains in Philosophy of the Encounter (2006). In turn, this line of immanent materialism takes us to the more recent speculations of new materialism and posthuman theory, for instance in Donna Haraway’s and Bruno Latour’s work, and even more to the theory of the event in the work of Deleuze and Alain Badiou. This theoretical frame would have productively challenged and complicated Vicks’s method and argument. If the book had presented the question of immanence in these terms, and shown reality to be the product of the encounter of different, historically traceable elements, the book would have avoided its unwitting occasional slippage into the language of transcendence: see, for instance, the “Truth with capital T” Vicks argues about in the case of Nabokov, when nothing as a form of postmodern immanence becomes hypostatized as the Truth, capitalized to signal its absolute, nonhuman-made value.Widening her theoretical repertoire to include the discourse of post-atomism and of the event would have allowed Vicks to think about nothing historically. As things stand, the language that emerges from the khora is transhistorical and, as such, immutable. Gogol and Melville are introduced as predecessors of the twentieth-century interest in nothing, without any specific reason suggested for the appearance of such narratives in the middle of the nineteenth century in two very different countries. A few questions are in order: Why does the book focus on the twentieth century as the century of nothing in literature? How does the modern interest in nothing measure up, by contrast, with the horror vacui of Baroque seventeenth-century culture? Why does the paradigm of nothing, of void, get reversed about three centuries later? How would the book deal with the destruction of the self elaborated by Georges Bataille or by Jean Genet, arguably another important figuration of nothing in the twentieth century?At several points Vicks seems open to the necessary historicization of her problematic. In the introduction, for example, she mentions a number of artists and their aesthetics in terms that call for a discussion that goes beyond formalism and philosophy: post–World War I Dada, Vladimir Mayakovski, Andrei Platanov, the composers Arvo Pärt, John Cage, Keith Jarrett, as well as Mark Rothko, Yves Klein, and Andy Warhol, all seem to open the space for a cultural critique that never materializes. This is the case with the work of Victor Pelevin, which both the writer himself and Vicks relate to the economic and cultural condition of post-Soviet Russia. Another consequence of the lack of historicity in the book and of Vicks’s choice to present nothing as transhistorical is her turn to postmodernity and postmodernism as mainly a matter of language and style. Even if the author mentions “the postmodern condition” and “the crisis of modernity in the West” (136), hardly any attention is paid to the historical and cultural aspects of postmodernity. Here the work of David Harvey, in addition to that of Derrida, Maurice Blanchot, and the barely mentioned Jean Baudrillard and François Lyotard, would have been useful to give postmodernity a more substantial representation. The fact that nothing “is the transcendental signifier of the 20th century” (175), and that “nothing [is] the truest reality that cannot be registered by human ways of knowing,” are the most exciting and problematic points of this original book: on the one hand, these statements invoke Lacan, and, on the other, they echo Jameson’s lament of the loss of totality, as well as of the possibility to recognize it and map it. At the same time, the totality of nothing, rather than embodying the full reality and image of capital that Jameson is after, tends to become a form of the sublime. As such it manifests itself in fragments, gaps, silences, and “the abyss.” Ultimately, it is caught in the all-too-airless space of aesthetics, here a sort of postmodern art for art’s sake, as harbinger of the ineffable, and of an immanence that is not part of human temporality.",Absurdism | Art | Contradiction | Epistemology | Literature | Meaning (existential) | Narrative | Nothing | Philosophy,https://openalex.org/W2905188313,0.0,,OpenAlex,9

University of Minnesota Press https://www.upress.umn.edu/book-division/books/the-anguish-of-thought 180 pages; Print, $24.95 ""At the heart of modern writing,"" Évelyne Grossman writes, ""anguish designates that which occurs in closest proximity to thought."" Expertly weaving together strands from the work of Jacques Derrida, Emmanuel Levinas, Samuel Beckett, and Maurice Blanchot, among others, Grossman produces, in her newly translated The Anguish of Thought, a compelling and suggestive argument about our sometimes painful, sometimes ecstatic experiences of being inspired by and through writing. ""All experience it differently,"" she argues, ""and yet there is a profound commonality to all these experiences in that they all rattle the assured bases of what we believe to be our own thought, our own identity."" Originally published as L'Angoisse de penser (2008), this book joins the continuous philosophical and poetic debates about how to theorize literature as well as historical investigations into the experience of anguish. Grossman, as a well-established scholar of Antonin Artaud, emphasizes the performative aspects of reading and writing while drawing upon the work of major twentieth-century philosophers and writers of the French scene in order to argue for an understanding of anguish that forefronts how it pushes one to be ""out of oneself,"" its creative force. The author's easy familiarity with the theories in play allows her a great latitude to find patterns across texts and examine similarities between these oft-discussed thinkers, and she does so [End Page 45] generously: generous both in advancing her ambitious hypotheses and in the relative accessibility of her argument. To be clear, background knowledge on the cited critical theorists and writers is recommended if not mandatory for readers. However, for anyone who has struggled alongside the difficult texts of the above writers, it is a genuine pleasure to read Grossman process and reframe that difficulty, synthesize their major ideas, and present her own with clarity. In the introductory chapter, Grossman deftly links these chosen figures through their shared tropes and concerns: the affective experiences of fatigue, nausea, ecstasy, and excessive negativity; the desire for access to an inhumanity or dishumanity beyond human finitude; a certain vision of existence on the level of atoms, emphasizing entanglement over strict, coherent identities; and finally a definition of inspiration that depends crucially on the aspiration (with some beautiful wordplay around the ""breath"") of the other. From Grossman's web of thinkers, writing emerges as a ""profound experience of depersonalization,"" a dizziness that provokes anguish but which also animates us. Despite the book's focus on writing, the ""literary"" here follows tradition to signify thought broadly—it is less a matter of craft, though the latter half of the book does contain some detailed close readings of Beckett and Blanchot, and more a matter of conceptual form. The ""other"" that inspires us is not a political category (Grossman stresses this, perhaps disappointingly) nor any iterable form or identifiable entity—rather, it is that which rattles us out of ourselves, puts to question one's sense of oneself. The Anguish of Thought is above all a book about the practice of thinking, understood as both a destabilizing and generative experience. The study ranges from investigating Derrida and Levinas's ""mad"" commitments to the voice of the other in chapters two and three; to positing Beckett's ""ephectic subject"" in light of structural concepts of metalanguage, archive, and ""dead form"" in chapters four through six; to analyzing Blanchot's articulation of the project of writing as the ""heroism of an impersonal death"" in the final two chapters. (Alongside these central figures, the writings of Jacques Lacan, Michel Foucault, Georges Bataille, Roland Barthes, Gilles Deleuze, Catherine Malabou, and, of course, Artaud, also have a vocal [End Page 46] presence throughout the book.) Spun together, these explorations show the shared obsession of these thinkers with ""the recurring question of how, through writing, can the unthinkable be touched upon"" as well as the different ways that they have all tried to answer it.

Hyde,,2011,2011-01-01,Rhetoric and Public Affairs,,article,en,False,"Reviewed by: Inessential Solidarity: Rhetoric and Foreigner Relations Michael J. Hyde Inessential Solidarity: Rhetoric and Foreigner Relations. By Diane Davis . Pittsburgh: University of Pittsburgh Press, 2010; pp xi + 214. $24.95 paper. Diane Davis would have us believe that ""The condition for ontology, for epistemology, for ethics and politics . . . is rhetoric, as the limitless and underivable imperative to respond, which is irreducible to any principle or norm"" (121). She makes her case primarily with the help of Emmanuel Levinas's philosophy of ""the Other"" (Autrui). Her reading of Levinas is advanced as she brings into the discussion such influential philosophers and critics as Martin Heidegger, Jacques Derrida, Jean-Luc Nancy, Avital Ronell, Kenneth Burke, and Maurice Blanchot. Professor Davis is a well-read intellectual and an exceptionally talented writer. Inessential Solidarity is an outstanding piece of scholarship, a fine read, and controversial, too. Davis writes for an audience that is already somewhat knowledgeable about Levinasian thought; that is, they at least have some understanding and appreciation of the traditions of continental philosophy and Judaism that inform and are challenged by Levinas's philosophy and its often complex and cryptic discourse. So, for example, reading and understanding Levinas without knowing some basic positions set forth in Heidegger's Being and Time, is, I submit, impossible. Levinas without Heidegger makes no sense. Levinas admits as much: ""who undertakes to philosophize [today] cannot not have gone through Heidegger's philosophy, even to escape it. This thought is a great event of our century"" (Ethics and Infinity, trans. Richard A. Cohen, Duquesne University Press, 1985, 42). But Heidegger without Levinas is dangerous. Unlike Levinas, Heidegger fails to develop an extensive appreciation of the ethical and moral issues that arise in light of our necessary relationship with others. This deficiency in Heidegger is the sine qua non of much of Levinas's work. Davis has a good deal to say about the matter, for her book is meant to convince readers that (1) Levinas's philosophy is the way to go if we want to be as open as possible to the needs of others as we build interpersonal relationships with them, and (2) following Levinas's understanding of the fundamental ethical and moral relationship that we have with the other, we can discover how a ""primordial rhetoric"" is at work in our social and political lives, thereby acknowledging the ontological and ethical significance of this ""practical"" art. I agree with both of these claims, for I have advanced a version of them throughout my work on three related phenomena: the call of conscience, the life-giving gift of acknowledgment, and human being's [End Page 589] perfectionist impulse. With Davis, however, I have a passionate and much admired teacher and colleague who is more committed to Levinas than I am. Davis deals with the matter in both her kind praise and welcomed critical response to certain aspects of my work. The criticism is essentially this: People like Hyde, who seek some philosophical guidance from Heidegger, are too often too quick to apply his observations to everyday practical rhetorical situations, thereby missing or not treating seriously enough Levinas's highly nuanced analysis of the ""otherness"" in our lives. I must admit that in a more appropriate venue, I would strongly declare my innocence and offer a rebuttal, too. But that is not the point of this review. Davis's work is robust with insights that bring clarity to Levinas's project. As she indicates in her introduction, she wants us to think about what she believes Levinas would praise: ""a rhetoric of responsibility."" Davis discusses the nature of such a rhetoric as she turns to Levinas for guidance in investigating the topics of identification, figuration, hermeneutics, agency, and judgment. The discussion of these topics is superb. Along the way we are shown that even though Levinas lacks a full appreciation of the scope and function of rhetoric, he nevertheless proves invaluable for understanding the origins and natures of the rhetorical situations in which we find ourselves every day. In her chapter on hermeneutics, Davis makes her point by critically assessing the work of influential rhetorical theorist and critic Steven Mailloux.

How could I begin without letting this language resonate within me, this French language that I will never feel absolutely at home in but that I nevertheless have come to love—and perhaps because of its foreignness—in large part thanks to Jacques Derrida? How could I begin thinking of him without letting these words reverberate within me, these words—""Alors, qui êtes-vous?""—since these were the very first words Jacques Derrida ever addressed to me, on the threshold of what would become—and I feel privileged to use the term—a friendship? ""Alors, qui êtes-vous?"" I would like to emphasize at the outset that these are Jacques Derrida's words, not my own, so that no one is misled by my title into thinking that I would have the temerity of asking the question, ""Qui êtes-vous, Jacques Derrida?"", or the audacity to think I could actually provide a response. ""Qui êtes-vous?""—that is a question I never posed and will never pose to Jacques Derrida. I underscore this because it is so tempting today, in the wake of Jacques Derrida's death on October 9,2004, to want to claim some special privilege, some unique intimacy, with the man or his work, in order to say something definitive about him or it. It is tempting to think that one can offer some final judgment, now that that life and that work have, it seems, come to an end. As Maurice Blanchot said at the end of Friendship, a text Jacques Derrida knew so well, this time just after the death of a thinker we've read, known, and admired is ""the moment of complete works,"" the terrible moment when ""one wants to publish 'everything,'"" when ""one wants to say 'everything,' . . . as if the 'everything is said' would finally allow us to stop a dead voice, to stop the pitiful silence that arises from it"" (289-90). It is the moment when we are tempted by a final evaluation, a final reckoning, the moment when we feel more licensed than usual to go beyond the facts, to say something more than just ""Jacques Derrida was born in 1930, in El Biar, Algeria; he went to France in the early 1950s, graduated from the Ecole Normale Supérieure and later took a teaching position at that same institution, eventually becoming known in France and, indeed, [End Page 6] throughout the world through his more than fifty books, translated into dozens of languages, for a type of philosophical and literary analysis known as 'deconstruction.'"" It is the moment when the living feel justified, perhaps even entitled, to go beyond these facts to assess the merits of the man and his work and assign them some definitive place in the history of French letters or of Western philosophy. Faced with such a temptation, we would do well to recall what Blanchot once wrote after the death of his friend Georges Bataille, near the very end, once again, of Friendship. How could one agree to speak of this friend? Neither in praise nor in the interest of some truth. The traits of his character, the forms of his existence, the episodes of his life, even in keeping with the search for which he felt himself responsible to the point of irresponsibility, belong to no one. There are no witnesses. Those who were closest say only what was close to them, not the distance that affirmed itself in this proximity, and distance ceases as soon as presence ceases. ""Alors, qui êtes-vous?"" These words and the gestures and tone that accompanied them live on today—Blanchot is right—only in me, in my memory, so that everything I say might end up revealing only what was closest to me, and not Jacques Derrida.

Who could give whom the right to forgive on behalf of the dead, and to forgive the infinite violence that was done to them, depriving them of both a grave and a name, everywhere in the world and not only at Auschwitz? And thus everywhere that the unforgivable would have taken place? — Jacques Derrida, "". . . . . . . .""1 ""What else is there to say?"" Jeffrey Mehlman's The Legacies of Anti-semitism in France (1983) and his subsequent essay ""Pour Saint-Beuve""(1996) are works of accusation. Emerging in the aftermath of a cultural crisis in which Paul de Man's articles for Le Soir and Martin Heidegger's involvement with National Socialism apparently left in jeopardy the claims of deconstruction, Mehlman's works (like several others, by Steven Ungar and Michael Holland in particular) scrutinize Maurice Blanchot's wartime journalism. Blanchot, as Mehlman writes in ""Pour Saint-Beuve,"" ""was about fifteen years Paul de Man's senior, [and] had a job during the war not all that different from the one Paul de Man had accepted with Le Soir in Brussels"" (215). The implication of this analogy is clear. While de Man's articles for Le Soir have been recognized to be juvenilia – influenced by family attachments as much as political attachments, even they have prompted a re-evaluation of de Man's intellectual project, a critique of his teaching style, and in most cases condemnation of his choice to avoid publicly claiming his responsibility for these articles.2 Should we not, Mehlman implies, put Blanchot to the same test? Blanchot wrote the articles under consideration not as a nineteen-year-old, but as an adult in his 30s, and for this reason, if for no other, he must be recognized as the law would recognize him: a guilty adult subject. But what would such a guilt imply? What kind of outcome do these accusations serve? Mehlman states that his aim is to reorient the focus of literary history by condemning Blanchot and revealing Blanchot's involvement with the collaborationist press, yet the volume in which Mehlman's essay appears – a collection of essays emerging from a 1993 conference – seems [End Page 85] concerned not to condemn Blanchot, but to exonerate him.3 Mehlman's ""Pour Saint-Beuve"" is the very last essay in the collection; it is preceded by a short letter from Blanchot to Roger Laporte. Blanchot's letter (Which Laporte read aloud at the conference) is both a thank-you note and an explanation. Having learned the enigmatic title of Mehlman's contribution, Laporte sought out the 1942 article to which it referred and sent a copy to Blanchot. That Blanchot's explanation of the article precedes Mehlman's essay makes for an anachronous reading experience that is not neutralized by two extensive translator's notes explaining why the letter appears in the volume, and why in 1992 (in the weeks preceding the conference) Blanchot is writing about a 1942 article. The appearance of Blanchot's letter in advance of the essay that it treats can be understood as an effort at immunization. It implies that Blanchot had acknowledged, rather than evaded, his mistake, and that he did so prior to Mehlman's accusation. In other words, the effect is to exonerate. Yet, in the letter, Blanchot also claims to have no recollection of having written the 1942 piece, a claim both understandable (it is a fifty-year-old article, from a time when Blanchot wrote weekly reviews) and uncomfortable (how could he have forgotten?). This discomfort is due not to the assumption that forgetting releases Blanchot from responsibility for having mentioned collaborator Charles Maurras in a collaborationist journal (the Occupation-dominated Nouvelle Revue Française) but, rather, that Blanchot's admission leaves his role in his own misjudgment unclear. In the letter to Laporte, Blanchot admits the ""indelible stain"" and ""expression of dishonour"" that accompany his mention of Maurras in 1942. Blanchot's gesture is not a clear offer of apology or excuse, just as it is not without acknowledgement of a mistake.

Published in more than twenty-five books spanning over eighty years, his oeuvre can be divided into three categories: (1) his philosophical works, which regroup monographs, essays, and interviews, (2) his Talmudic readings and essays on Judaism, and (3) posthumous notes, remarks, and texts, some of which are still being published. Although references will be made to the second and third categories, the first remains the central focus of this article. Apart from the influence of Husserl, Levinas was also inspired by Martin Heidegger as well as by Maurice Blanchot and Jacques Derrida. Of Heidegger, he wrote an uncompromising philosophical critique that addressed the secondary role played by ethics in his phenomenology—a critique he then expanded to the Western philosophical tradition as a whole. Ethics, Levinas argued, had to be reinterpreted and understood as “first philosophy” (i.e., as metaphysics), rather than as a derivative extension based on premises coming from ontological, epistemological, or political narratives. Not unlike Plato centuries before, although in a different manner and with very different implications, Levinas contended that the question of the Good has priority over that of Being, since interhuman relationality precedes any discourse or logos about beings—human or otherwise. His “ethics” is thus not that of the tradition: its aim is not to become prescriptive. Without denying the importance of the following properties or faculties for practical decision making, Levinas’s ethics relies neither on virtues, reason, nor utility. The word “ethics,” for Levinas, refers to the fact that “I” cannot refuse responsibility for the other, since that act of disregarding or refusing responsibility is possible only on the basis of my being always already capable of responding to an other who imposes responsibility on me. It is this ability for responding to the other, this command that I cannot efface (even when I ignore it) that allows for other discourses—such as ontology, epistemology, or political philosophy—to make sense at all. The consequences of this original interpretation of the nature and meaning of ethics are deep and manifold. Therefore, this article does not intend to present an all-encompassing portrait of Emmanuel Levinas’s thought. Rather, its aim is to provide the reader with a selection of texts that represent the wide array of philosophical questions addressed by Levinas and his commentators. Given the immense number of publications by Levinas, this entry proposes a commented list of selected major works and articles by the author (instead of referencing complete collections, for instance).

10.1353/tae.0.0055,"40 Years of Structure, Sign and Play",Ryan Bishop | John Phillips,,2009,2009-01-01,Theory & Event,,article,en,False,"40 Years of Structure, Sign and Play Ryan Bishop (bio) and John W P Phillips (bio) Introduction During the week of October 18–21, 1966, an international symposium on “The Languages of Criticism and the Sciences of Man” was held under the auspices of the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. Initiated by René Girard, Richard Macksey and Eugenio Donato, the symposium celebrated structuralist theory for the first time in the United States as an interdisciplinary program. By inviting well known representatives from several fields of the humanities and social sciences the organizers sought a meeting of philosophy and literature in connection with linguistic, anthropological and mathematical sciences. Jean Hyppolite, representing phenomenology, and George Poulet and Lucien Goldmann, representing approaches to literature, went up against Roland Barthes, Tzvetan Todorov, and Nicholas Ruwet, representing structuralism. Girard also invited Jacques Lacan, in light of his structuralist revision of Freud, and Jacques Derrida, having in mind a recent critical work by Derrida on Lévi-Strauss. The “Preface” to the symposium proceedings, which were published as The Structuralist Controversy, ed. Richard Macksey and Eugenio Donato (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins, 1970), gives an account of the event: The sessions were convened under the auspices of the Johns Hopkins Humanities Center, during the week of October 18–21, 1966, when over one hundred humanists and social scientists from the United States and eight other countries gathered in Baltimore. The symposium inaugurated a two-year program of seminars and colloquia which sought to explore the impact of contemporary “structuralist” thought on critical methods in humanistic and social studies. The general title emphasized both the pluralism of the existing modes of discourse and the interaction of disciplines not entirely limited to the conventional rubric of the “humanities.” (xv). Jacques Derrida, the youngest of the European participants (still ostensibly under Hyppolite’s supervision), contributed the enigmatically written “Structure, Sign and Play in the Discourse of the Human Sciences.” In the following year Derrida published three volumes: L’écriture et la différence [Writing and Difference], De la grammatologie (Of Grammatology) and La voix et le phénomène [Speech and Phenomena], which arguably established him at the front of the avant garde in high theory and helped to inaugurate a fundamental shift in Anglo-American academic practice. A genuine interest in structuralist method was evident amongst specialists both on the continent and in the US at the time; but the rumblings of an increasingly influential mass media also began to join in the conversation. In France Michel Foucault’s Les mots et les choses [The Order of Things], published early in 1966, helped establish structuralism as a kind of cultural fashion to both widespread celebration and reactive disapproval. The book drew detailed criticism from traditional corners of academia but also became one of those rare commodities, an academic best seller. In the wake of this burgeoning interest, the Baltimore event signaled several kinds of turning point in intellectual history. Elizabeth Roudinesco captures something of its carnival quality in her book on Lacan: “The Americans thrilled to the sharply Gallic flavor of the exchanges, and the French guests were flattered at being so honored. The structuralist feast remained Latinate—a continental dispute staged as a Western, the local press would say” (411). The English coinage, “post-structuralism,” appeared for the first time shortly afterwards and indicates some of the perceptions that were developing in America in response to the work of Lacan, Barthes and Derrida in particular. Arguably the most enigmatic and apparently hybrid presentations of the event have had the most profound and lasting influences historically. Nevertheless, the collection Writing and Difference, in which “Structure, Sign and Play” appears, is remarkable for its time in posing an intricate and closely argued distance between Derrida’s modes of writing and what was most current in contemporary thinking, including the works of Martin Heidegger, Maurice Blanchot, Edmund Husserl, Emmanuel Levinas and Georges Bataille, as well as the various re-elaborations by Foucault, Lacan, and Barthes, of the masters of modern critical theory, Nietzsche, Freud and de Saussure. Allying himself instead with what remained most classically “purist” in contemporary thought, Derrida sets out a fundamental radicalization of classical philosophy.

10.1353/tfr.2012.0408,The Figural Jew: Politics and Identity in Postwar French Thought by Sarah Hammerschlag,Kārlis Račevskis,,2012,2012-01-01,The French review,,article,en,False,"about “la francophonie” and the notion of a “littérature-monde.” This volume is certain to foster a more comprehensive understanding of these complex issues. University of Nebraska, Omaha Patrice J. Proulx HAMMERSCHLAG, SARAH. The Figural Jew: Politics and Identity in Postwar French Thought. Chicago: UP of Chicago, 2010. ISBN 978-0-226-31512-6. Pp. 312. $25. As the title suggests, Sarah Hammerschlag’s main purpose is to examine the significance and functioning of a trope. By studying the way in which Jews and Jewishness are represented in French literature and philosophy, especially after World War II, the author not only sheds light on social and cultural change, but also promotes a new way of dealing with such politically charged issues as multiculturalism and identity politics. For example, a tropological approach is able to enact a process of “défiguration”—a term coined by Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe— and open up “the possibility of figural language calling attention to itself, calling itself into question as representation and truth source” (14). What makes such an approach particularly useful, Hammerschlag argues convincingly, is its capacity for counteracting myth and disabling the political exploitation of mythological representations. While she begins her study with the Dreyfus Affair and the figure of the uprooted Jew popularized by Maurice Barrès, the key moment in the evolution of the trope, for her, is May 68 because “it marks a turning point in the history of the significance of the Jew as French cultural and political symbol” (6). It was occasioned by the French government’s decision to prevent Daniel CohnBendit , one of the student leaders, from reentering France. Energized by the interdiction , the students expressed their solidarity with Cohn-Bendit—who happened to be a German Jew—by adopting the slogan “Nous sommes tous des juifs allemands.” Since it claimed an identity impossible to assume, the slogan was clearly paradoxical but, as Maurice Blanchot was to explain, while it rejected traditional forms of a communal affiliation, it also represented the possibility of turning a negation into an affirmation, “of maintaining a refusal that affirms” (197). By May 68, the figure of the Jew had already been given a positive value by Sartre. Emmanuel Levinas eventually reconfigured the notion of rootlessness into a moral ideal, but it was the work of two of his followers in this area—Blanchot and Derrida—that became particularly significant in developing both a theory and a practice of the figure’s tropological deployment. Specifically, they “cultivate the figurative nature of the postwar representation of the Jew in order to develop a political strategy that offers a real alternative to the universalism-particularism dichotomy” (263). The productive tension between the two positions becomes especially apparent in Derrida’s treatment of the notion of exemplarity. It is a troubling claim, Derrida finds, being convinced that any appeal to a morally superior stance and universal values eventually engenders violence. The alternative to the dilemma, he proposes, is undecidability—a consideration that turns positive once we realize that it undermines anyone’s claim to election or exceptionalism. To recognize the necessity to go beyond the dichotomy of particularism-universalism is to enter on the path to a “new mode of political engagement,” Hammerschlag tells us. It is an alternative that can prove useful in France’s efforts to integrate its Muslim minority within the traditional fabric of French republicanism as well as in the United States, “in our universities and in the larger sphere of our national politics,” since these Reviews 553 are areas where “we are attempting to move beyond the debates over multiculturalism and to find new ways of defining and understanding pluralism” (266). Given the clarity and eloquence of her analyses, Hammerschlag’s book will be a welcome resource in diverse fields of study and offer a useful teaching strategy in a university setting—even though French theory has lost some of its luster and influence . The public at large, however, may not be quite as prepared to assimilate or even appreciate the sophistication and radical originality that distinguish the arguments presented here.

10.1353/tfr.2014.0165,Kierkegaard’s Influence on Philosophy: Francophone Philosophy ed. by Jon Stewart,Yolande Aline Helm,,2014,2014-01-01,The French review,,article,en,False,"an approach that Christopher Dyer describes as“pauper-centered.”Drawing on a wide range of resources, the authors avoid reducing the poor to an undifferentiated mass by inferring from their sources the life circumstances of identifiable paupers, including unmarried mothers, apprenticed youth, and age-differentiated single women. Two themes are prominent throughout the volume: the symbiotic relationship between the poor and the non-poor, and the way in which this reciprocity is marked, over time, by a shift towards accountability. The second part,“Forms of Poor Relief,” features a strong contribution by Susan Broomhall in which she uses records of the Paris HôtelDieu and its governors to outline the transition from a religiously-based response to an increasingly secularized program reliant on administrative machinery. Reciprocity also evokes the moral question of worth which underlies the third part,“Textual and Visual Representations.” The discursive power of poverty as a signifier is evident, as Mark Amsler shows, in the “re-reading” of the poor in light of the voluntary poverty of groups such as the Waldensians. By contrast, Scott’s study of a fourteenth-century poem, “La voie de povreté et de richesse,” offers a secular reformulation of the issue, showing how this didactic expression of the anxiety of the recently-married protagonist frames poverty as a question of moral turpitude set against the laudable goal of pursuing material wealth. Three plates of manuscript illustrations accompany Scott’s analysis of this little-studied poem, though a fourth, referred to as this volume’s frontispiece, is missing. Scott and her colleagues have brought together an impressive breadth of perspectives on poverty which spans four centuries and ranges over questions of age, gender, religion, and social and economic change. Given the high quality of the writing, and with its consistent emphasis on giving identity to the poor, this book will be valuable to any reader wishing to better understand the complex texture of poverty in pre-modern England and France.

As this volume shows, the French intellectual tradition concurs with Kierkegaard’s heterogeneous profile since its prominent authors are difficult to compartmentalize, as they often blend literary criticism, philosophy, theology, or “simple” writing. Newmark’s “Sylviane Agacinski: Reading Kierkegaard to Keep Intact the Secret” underlines the legacy Agacinski has bestowed upon the philosopher’s work. She evokes the figure of Abraham in Kierkegaard’s work as the symbol of “the most profound love of human finitude” (18). In “Roland Barthes: Style, Language, Silence,” Westfall demonstrates how Barthes and Kierkegaard were analogous in their predilection to blur the lines between autobiography, fiction, and philosophy. Llevadot (“Georges Bataille: Kierkegaard and the Claim for the Sacred”) highlights Kierkegaard’s 250 FRENCH REVIEW 88.1 Reviews 251 admiration of Abraham, the “unknown God” (59).

Timmann Mjaaland (“Jacques Derrida: Faithful Heretics”) indicates that Derrida was influenced by the premise of religion in the philosopher’s writings. “Jacques Ellul: Kierkegaard’s Profound and Seldom Acknowledged Influence on Ellul’s Writings,” by Pike Cabral, reveals the belief Kierkegaard and Ellul share: that individualism is the path to faith,in opposition to Christendom,which prevents its achievement.

Levinas was particularly in disagreement with him as an inspiration for Judaism. In addition, he felt the philosopher was a “thinker of egotism” and aggressive in his thoughts. Leo Stan (“Jean-Luc Marion: The Paradoxical Givenness of Love”) conveys the quarrel Marion has with Kierkegaard. The former views Christ as “an entirely unforeseeable event” in contrast with the latter who conceives Christ as “an absolute or eternally offensive paradox” (229). Rasmussen’s “Paul Ricœur: On Kierkegaard, the Limits of Philosophy, and the Consolation of Hope” imparts the influence of Kierkegaard on Ricœur in terms of forgiveness and anguish. Ricœur was particularly affected by What we Learn from the Lilies in the Field and the Birds of the Air (1847), a text both men regarded as a “Godly diversion”(252) through which humans can lessen their affliction.A brilliant example of scholarship, this well-referenced collection will appeal to specialists.

In her second novel, Alard (Prix Roger Nimier, 2010) portrays a married couple in conflict. Juliette learns, through her husband Olivier’s admission, of his affair with Victoire, a work associate with whom he has fallen in love. Contrary to typical accounts of conjugal life that end because of infidelity, this story, by focusing alternately on the characters’ feelings, portrays the manner in which Juliette and Olivier collaborate in order to save their marriage. For Olivier, the affair fulfills a need to feel valued. Juliette rejected him sexually after the birth of their second child, and then demoralized him further by saying: “Je ne suis pas sûre de vouloir vieillir avec toi” (117). She thereby voiced his biggest fear, namely that he did not measure up to his wife’s expectations for him as a husband and a father.Whereas Olivier considers Juliette to be ultra-critical of his behavior, he feels the complete approval of Victoire in “ses regards extasiés et [ses] manifestations bruyantes du plaisir qu’il lui donnait”(123).Although he professes his ongoing love for Juliette,Olivier is disinclined to end his affair withVictoire.Olivier’s honesty with Juliette spurs her into action to salvage their marriage. She readily accepts her share of responsibility for the impasse that they have reached. Couples’counseling and her own soul-searching lead her to understand that their communication styles diverge completely: “[L]es mots pour lui, pour elle[-même], n’avaient pas le même sens” (82). If she wants to discuss a problem until it is resolved, Olivier often prefers to ruminate in silence first. She therefore realizes that reaching Olivier emotionally must be on his terms, that is, sexually, in bed.

While elements of his work share with Levinas and Heidegger a problematic privileging of the human, Blanchot nevertheless offers the basis of what might be seen as a timely 'deeper ecological' thinking, one that can engage the destructive anthropocentrism of Western thought and tradition in the very minutiae of its literary and philosophical texts. Unlike in much 'green' philosophy, no concept of nature or earth serves as foundation for Blanchot's thought. He is engaged by the 'impossible' as that which is not a matter of human power or decision, affirmed in both its ethical force and its contestation of dominant and appropriative conceptions of knowledge, rationality and invention. A comparison is offered between Max Oelschlager's representative ecocritical essay 'Earth-Talk: Conservation and Ecology', with its romantic attempt to find and celebrate modes of unalienated or 'natural' language, and Blanchot's practice of what can be seen as a more radical and questioning 'ecology' based on almost opposite conceptions.",Aesthetics | Art | Philosophy,https://openalex.org/W4249351161,0.0,,"Crossref, OpenAlex",9

En su intervencion senala que se encuentra alli tratando de hablar sobre el “ultimo juguete” de Alberto Giordano: las escrituras de la intimidad. Por el ano 2004 Giordano trabajaba sobre el “ensayo de los escritores”: ya habia publicado Modos del ensayo. Jorge Luis Borges-Oscar Masotta (1991) y estaba compilando los escritos que reunira en Modos del ensayo. De Borges a Piglia (2005). A tres anos de aquel congreso y a proposito de la aparicion de su nuevo libro, Una posibilidad de vida. Escrituras intimas (que como Modos del ensayo. De Borges a Piglia incluye textos puestos a circular antes de tomar la forma de letra impresa), cabe llamar la atencion sobre dos movimientos perceptibles en el campo de la critica literaria escrita desde Argentina. Uno: la profusion de trabajos sobre los ensayos de escritores. Dos, y este es un fenomeno mas reciente: la profusion de trabajos sobre diarios de escritores. Mas alla de la humorada es posible advertir en aquella intervencion de Aira parte de una verdad: desde su modo siempre oblicuo estaba senalando el nuevo rumbo del critico que luego iba a ser, por transferencia, el rumbo de otros. ?Tema, problema, capricho u obstinacion?: no interesa la etiqueta a partir de la cual intentamos describir el impulso.

10.1353/sym.2005.0046,Later Derrida: Reading the Recent Work (review),Simon Morgan Wortham,,2004,2004-01-01,symplokē,,article,en,False,"Reviewed by: Later Derrida: Reading the Recent Work Simon Morgan Wortham Herman Rapaport. Later Derrida: Reading the Recent Work. New York & London: Routledge, 2004. x + 158pp. In Later Derrida, Herman Rapaport collects together a series of essays in which some of Derrida’s more recent texts from the 1980s and 90s are forced into an always complex and frequently eccentric set of relationships with an array of thinkers and writers including Trinh Minh-ha, Gayatri Spivak, Martin Heidegger, Jean-Paul Sartre, Sigmund Freud, Maurice Blanchot, and Antonin Artaud. In fact, the apparently disparate nature of the four essays comprising the body of this work provides the occasion for a highly charged and often explosive series of connections—or rather collisions—to take place. With great subtlety, Rapaport violates deconstruction according to its own logic, or rather according to a logic which begins to emerge—or which promises to come—on the “hither side” of deconstruction. This other side of deconstruction—the “other” of deconstruction—intractably remains, forcefully persists, as an inappropriable excess going beyond the “classical” reception of deconstruction as an “origin” which helps give us the historical narrative of theory—and the [End Page 309] discipline of theoretical study and debate—constructed from the perspective of la pensee soixante-huit. Rapaport therefore sets about a violent reassemblage of Derrida, as deconstruction is forced into a series of antagonistic rather than contradictory relations with “others,” where antagonism arises, as Laclau and Mouffe have put it, “not from full totalities but from the impossibility of their constitution,” and where reading is thereby thrown into permanent crisis in the encounter of an incalculable set of trajectories, forces, positions and readings which come to be differentiated only in precarious and partial ways. Thus, while this book ventures strong and often contentious interpretations of its subject matter, its own style or disposition—unremittingly digressive, distracted, disorganized—refuses reduction to the traditional image of critique. Neither can an ultimately cohesive argument or “viewpoint” be discerned here, an exhaustive theory or reading of what might otherwise be termed “late” deconstruction. Rather, the book sets out to enact deconstruction’s “other” in a way that inevitably falls short, or which fails the test, of a thesis. Following a winding pathway through questions of cultural and philosophical inheritance, testimony, monolinguism, and the trauma of Holocaust, Derrida is brought into an ambivalent relationship with existential philosophy and the question of the subject. In the final essay, Artaud, Heidegger, Sartre and others collide improbably yet spectacularly with the “later Derrida,” crashing at high velocity so as to leave only shards or fragments of the subject scattered across the text as a scene of wreckage. Yet this wreckage is so devastating that a coherent or self-contained theory of the subject in deconstruction falls out of the equation, as if the “later Derrida” involves an inexpressible experience of trauma which accompanies the impossible vision of the subject’s demise. The subject is both “exploded” and “disseminated” in deconstruction, losing its form in an unrecoverable number of bits, so that deconstruction of the “whole” subject gives way to deconstruction’s “other,” an other composed of these smashed (and smashed-together) body parts. Rapaport’s Later Derrida is a brave and independent book—nearly the expression of an existential passion—but a book of which the cinder is perhaps the interminable trait. Against the unraveling backdrop of Heideggerian Destruktion, Blanchot’s near execution by the Nazis, the patricide of psychoanalysis and Holocaust, the “return” of religious fervor and the improbable persistence of an archive fever that madly burns, Later Derrida seems devoted to suiciding the proper in itself. How this drivenness-towards-death of deconstruction’s “other” might be viewed in such disparate yet powerful contexts remains difficult to decide: like the sati-suicide discussed in Spivak’s “Can the Subaltern Speak?” it remains undecidedly displaced and divided between political act and private passion, tradition and subversion, never quite making sense according to the classical subject-object categories of knowledge. That this interminable trait—the suicidal trait of the cinder—fails the test of a thesis (one of “9/11” or, more recently, the Beslan school siege) might perhaps be one of the...",Art | Biology | Deconstruction (building) | Ecology | Epistemology | Linguistics | Literature | Narrative | Philosophy | Reading (process),https://openalex.org/W2024757023,0.0,,OpenAlex,9

A lifelong friend of Levinas, he had a major influence on Foucault, Derrida, Nancy, and many others. Both his fiction and his criticism played a determining role in how postwar French philosophy was written, especially in its intense concern with the question of writing as such. Never an academic, he published most of his critical work in periodicals and led a highly private life. Yet his writing included an often underestimated public and political dimension. This posthumously published volume collects his political writings from 1953 to 1993, from the French-Algerian War and the mass movements of May 1968 to postwar debates about the Shoah and beyond. A large number of the essays, letters, and fragments it contains were written anonymously and signed collectively, often in response to current events. The extensive editorial work done for the original French edition makes a major contribution to our understanding of Blanchot’s work. The political stances Blanchot adopts are always complicated by the possibility that political thought remains forever to be discovered. He reminds us throughout his writings both how facile and how hard it is to refuse established forms of authority. The topics he addresses range from the right to insubordination in the French-Algerian War to the construction of the Berlin Wall and repression in Eastern Europe; from the mass movements of 1968 to personal responses to revelations about Heidegger, Levinas, and Robert Antelme, among others. When read together, these pieces form a testament to what political writing could be: not merely writing about the political or politicizing the written word, but unalterably transforming the singular authority of the writer and his signature.

Emmanuel Levinas and Maurice Blanchot, whose works constitute the most thorough contemporary exploration of the question of the other and of its relation to writing, are the main focus of this study. The book's horizon is ethics in the Levinasian sense: the question of the other, which, on the hither side of language understood as a system of signs and of representation, must be welcomed by language and preserved in its alterity. Martin Heidegger is an unavoidable reference, however. While it is true that for the German philosopher Being is an immanent production, his elucidation of a more essential understanding of Being entails a deconstruction of onto-theology, of the sign and the grammatical and logical determinations of language, all decisive starting points for both Levinas and Blanchot. At stake for both Levinas and Blanchot, then, is how to mark a nondiscursive excess within discourse without erasing or reducing it. How should one read and write the other in the same without reducing the other to the same? Critics in recent years have discussed an ""ethical moment or turn"" characterized by the other's irruption into the order of discourse. The other becomes a true crossroads of disciplines, since it affects several aspects of discourse: the constitution of the subject, the status of knowledge, the nature of representation, and what that representation represses (gender, power). Yet there has been a tendency to graft the other onto paradigms whose main purpose is to reassess questions of identity, fundamentally in terms of representation; the other thus loses some of its most crucial features. Through close readings of texts by Heidegger, Levinas, and Blanchot the book examines how the question of the other engages the very limits of philosophy, rationality, and power.",Computer science,https://openalex.org/W4221065725,0.0,,OpenAlex,9

At issue is the at first simple, even familiar, idea that literary or poetic 'meaning' cannot be stated in terms other than its own, that a text strives towards the status of being an example, if of anything, only of itself, sole witness of what it alone projects. This issue opens a series of powerful questions concerning basic features of Western thought - about the nature of understanding, on Kierkegaard's 'singular individual' that is yet each human life in its exceptionality, of the uniqueness of historical testimony, the nature of community. The Poetics of Singularity forms an ethically compelling alternative to the currently dominant cultural/social studies paradigm in literary criticism, a neo-Darwinian understanding of art and life which is sometimes only a disguised version of American nationalism. Key Features An original work of scholarship combining elucidation, research and polemics. Identifies a forceful tradition of twentieth-century poetics - which differs from received ideas of 'deconstruction' - which the author names 'the poetics of singularity'.

Dans un premier temps, nous avons montre que lorsqu'ils tentent de lire Blanchot, en un chiasme singulier, l'hermeneute tend a devenir deconstructeur et le deconstructeur tend a devenir hermeneute. Ensuite, nous avons propose une interpretation de la quasi-totalite des romans et des recits de Blanchot. Il apparait que l'œuvre narrative de Blanchot apporte une contribution fondamentale a la transformation du roman en recit, a la fois proche et differente de celle qu'operaient dans le meme temps Bataille, Duras, Des Fore����ts, Beckett, Laporte. . . Les recits de Blanchot, a priori tres abstraits, parlent de maniere inedite d'experiences concretes et fondamentales : la peau, le regard, le deuil, la hantise, la folie et la communaute. Enfin, dans le volet critique de son œuvre, nous avons montre que le chiasme plus ou moins subi par les lecteurs des recits est mis en pratique par Blanchot lui-meme. Avant que la deconstruction proprement dite n'apparaisse, Blanchot utilise des procedures hermeneutiques (allegorie, symbole, metaphore, distinction entre sens apparent et sens cache et recherche du centre d'une œuvre), d'une facon telle qu'il ne s'interesse qu'au moment precis ou ces procedures sont brisees par l'œuvre commentee, liberant un champ nouveau pour un exercice du commentaire qui rechercherait la proliferation des simulacres, la presence absence de l'image, la theâtralite de l'espace textuel, la pluralite idiomatique des langues et la derive syntaxique des mots sans butee derniere.",Humanities | Philosophy | Deconstruction (building) | Biology | Ecology,https://openalex.org/W119701234,0.0,,OpenAlex,9

10.1093/fs/knn168,Deconstruction and the Postcolonial: At the Limits of Theory,Esther Peeren,,2008,2008-12-23,French Studies,,article,en,False,"In this engaging and theoretically sophisticated book, Michael Syrotinski proposes a practice of ‘deconstructive postcolonialism’ that seeks to offset both deconstruction's perceived lack of political efficacy and the way much postcolonial thinking perpetuates the deterministic binary oppositions of the colonial system. Specifically, Syrotinski argues that ‘deconstruction as a highly vigilant reading practice can inform our critical understanding of specific postcolonial contexts’ (p. 59). From the book's enactments of this reading practice, it emerges as a rereading/rewriting that always doubles up on itself, yet through its very ambivalence can produce a glimmer of hope in the ‘starless night’ of the African postcolony (p. 117). Syrotinski begins by rereading Robert Young's genealogical narrative of deconstruction's postcolonial roots and Gayatri Spivak's hostile assessment of Spectres de Marx as disregarding the complexity of the double inscription central to Jacques Derrida's work. He also revisits the concepts of hybridity and fetishism, mobilizing, among others, Homi Bhabha's ‘savage hybridity’ and the films of Ousmane Sembene to establish deconstructive versions characterized by an irreducible ambivalence. The last chapters of the book are the most inventive, since they deal with lesser known theorists and move from rereading theory and concepts to using rereading and rewriting as concepts in the specific context of Francophone Africa. First, there is V.Y. Mudimbe's notion of reprendre. Against the view that Mudimbe is too dependent on Western frameworks, Syrotinski forcefully argues that reprendre does not constitute a repetition without difference but a reinvention that opens the way to an African subjectivity beyond identity politics and a form of representation that challenges the requirement of representational adequacy. Achille Mbembe's approach of ‘writing Africa’ is seen to produce similarly positive outcomes. After analysing two misreadings of Mbembe (with the assessment of Judith Butler's reading as determinist being not entirely persuasive), Syrotinski outlines how ‘writing Africa’ according to the redoubled responsibility performed by Mbembe creates not the pessimistic vision with which the latter is often associated but ‘a strong, positive and materially grounded vision of a future for Africa’ (p. 104). In his conclusion, Syrotinski tentatively links the previously explored practices of rereading/rewriting to Maurice Blanchot's ‘writing of the disaster’. Here, the book redoubles itself by moving from tracing the benefits of a turn to deconstruction by postcolonialism to investigating the potential of a postcolonial Blanchot, not in order to add another forefather to postcolonialism's genealogy, but to underline how deconstruction is far from a-political and rewriting the postcolony far from straightforward. What remains rather vague, however, is how exactly deconstructive postcolonialism translates into concrete political action. Readings of actual socio-political situations would have been helpful, as would more elaborate analyses of the novels and films Syrotinski touches upon. His exploration of the writings of Sony Labou Tansi, in particular, is tantalizingly brief. Nevertheless, Syrotinski's erudite theoretical explorations make this book essential reading for anyone interested in the intersection of two major approaches to the contemporary world.",Aesthetics | Ambivalence | Anthropology | Art | Binary opposition | Biology | Deconstruction (building) | Ecology | Epistemology | Gender studies | Hybridity | Literature | Philosophy | Postcolonialism (international relations) | Psychoanalysis | Psychology | Sociology | Vision,https://openalex.org/W1480308657,26.0,,OpenAlex,9

10.1093/fs/knr240,Les Grandes Notions litteraires,Russell Williams,,2011,2011-12-26,French Studies,,article,en,False,"Joël Loehr's slim volume boldly promises to tackle both the ‘grandes notions littéraires’ and the questions they raise. Each concept is allocated a chapter in which Loehr traces its historical development and discusses the subsequent scholarly implications. Practical examples are given from throughout the French literary canon, with an emphasis on the writings of André Malraux, on whom the author has previously published. The first chapter provides a genealogical overview of literary authorship, lucidly demonstrating how it emerged following the ‘authorless’ texts of antiquity before being called into question during the latter half of the twentieth century. The death of the author's supposed empowerment of the reader is examined in the second chapter. Loehr demonstrates how various literary epochs have manipulated the reading subject and suggests how reading has become increasingly viewed as an active process. As the author notes in his brief introduction, the work's broad ambition means some simplification is inevitable, even if this is frustrating on occasion: ‘Admettons qu'il y a des vides et des espaces libres dans un texte’ (p. 42). An examination of how characters mediate the relationship between author and reader forms the third chapter, with Loehr following the trajectory from creation to deconstruction and partial resurrection. A consideration of literary reality comprises the fourth chapter, which considers how texts negotiate the borders between fact and fiction. Loehr again argues there has been a key shift over time ‘de la représentation à la répétition’ (p. 89), reflecting a breakdown of linear narrative towards an increasing self-referentialilty. This leads to a consideration of whether literature has ‘devenue à la fois complètement narcissique et totalement autarcique’ (p. 96). Finally, genre is considered at the crossroads of authorial intention and reader expectation, before the assertion that literary boundaries are in a state of ‘révolution permanente’ (p. 120). Given its broad scope, the work is best suited as an introduction for the curious undergraduate keen for a lucid consideration of key literary concepts. This raises the question of whether those looking for a primer in literary theory would be better served by approaching the primary sources included in the work's end-of-chapter bibliographies, or starting with a more established work. Loehr's text does, however, have aspirations beyond that of a ‘Que sais-je?’ guide. It is here that the text risks wrong-footing readers looking for a concise starting point. While the text's overview of theory is generally helpful, it is framed with quotations from the resolutely anti-theoretical Maurice Blanchot suggesting that literature should not be categorized using alien concepts. Naturally, such a viewpoint risks undermining the ideas introduced throughout the work. Ultimately, Loehr's volume lacks a convincing argument and avoids proposing a view of how the notion of literature itself should be approached, instead concluding limply that ‘la critique s'est réinventée depuis la fin du siècle dernier, et […] elle se réinvente toujours, comme la littérature elle-même’ (p. 126).

In his previous book, Conversation Pieces: Community and Communication in Modern 41rt (2004), Kester put forward one of the most elaborate rationales for engaged community art to date, which he termed He did so by suggesting that community art represents a paradigm shift away from the non-discursive tactics of avant-garde contestation. Such methods, he argues, separate artists from their audience by construing the latter as non-discursive raw material that needs to be radicalized. While the better part of Conversation Pieces is dedicated to descriptions of dialogical art practices, this new book focuses much more concretely on the theoretical claims of the first to draw a far more rigid line in the sand. [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] Kester is a seasoned art critic with a long track record of insightful writing on the shift from public art and identity politics in the 1980s and '90s to the new phenomenon of community art in the '90s and 2000s. The type of site-specific collaborative work he champions today unfolds, he says, through an extended interaction with local communities. Like many proponents of new tendencies, he has worked to anchor his criticism in both social and political as well as the of aesthetics. In the first of three dense chapters he takes aim at the criticism of Nicolas Bourriaud and Claire Bishop, two authors whose ideas founder on the shores of an outmoded modernism. It's not so much that the boundaries between avant-garde and community art can't be determined, he says, it's rather that the mainstream of art has not fully understood the social and political implications of the new practices, which complicate conventional notions of aesthetic autonomy (9-10). Mille erudite and knowledgeable, Kester's polemic is intensely prescriptive. For the sake of artist groups like Park Fiction, Ala Plastica, Huite Facettes, and Dialogue, so much theory must fall to the wayside, including the work of Roland Barthes, Jacques Derrida, Michel de Certeau, Jean-Francois Lyotard, Julia Kristeva, Maurice Blanchot, Alain Badiou, Gilles Deleuze and Felix Gnat tari, Giorgio Agamben, jean-Luc Nancy, Emmanuel Levinas, Jacques Ranciere--and anyone associated with the post-May '68 generation of postmodern pessimism, or who guards against premature totalizations. Kester shows signs here of what we all know, which is something like a beyond to the of history and end of meta-narratives discourse, but he is careful to avoid proposing a re-radicalization that returns to the tropes of the past. …",Art | Art history | Avant garde | Visual arts,https://openalex.org/W348183285,0.0,,OpenAlex,9

Negative phenomenologies repress difference as the transcendental and the empirical are repetitions of the same through iterability. I argue that a negative phenomenology or a reversal of phenomenology repeats it rather than managing to escape from it. This is because it still proceeds within its metaphysical vocabulary and ontological structure. Thus, Merleau-Ponty and Blanchot, in inverting and reversing phenomenology, only repeat it by borrowing entirely from its metaphysical vocabulary and structure. Derrida’s phenomenology in place, is a meta-phenomenology in discovering the origin of phenomenology as difference, or the difference between philosophy and non-philosophy, transcendental and empirical. Derrida discovers the condition of possibility for phenomenology as quasi-transcendental, or the interval between the transcendental and empirical which conditions phenomenology in its entirety. The transcendental and empirical are paradoxically identical and non-identical because the difference translates into sameness.",Transcendental number | Phenomenology (philosophy) | Metaphysics | Philosophy | Epistemology,https://openalex.org/W2969408840,2.0,,OpenAlex,9

While the figure of the Jew began as the essentialized and accidental simplification of a very real historical people, it became a trope with a history in its own right. Emmanuel Levinas suggested that the reasons for which Jews had been denigrated must also be used as the reasons that Judaism should be venerated.

The requirement of truthfulness, honesty or objectivity of the authorial voice appears subjected to a disturbing complicity between fiction and testimony.

As the author shows, Virno explores the way in which what he calls virtuosity draws upon what he calls the ""background"" of speech, which, the author argues, is linked to the idea of the impersonal form ""one speaks"" in Deleuze and Guattari. Blanchot gives an alternative account of this ""background"", focusing on its operation in the interpersonal relation he characterises as messianic. Since Blanchot's account of the interpersonal relation is developed in his theoretical work chiefly through a reading of Levinas, the author traces Blanchot's divergence from his friend on the key question of the significance of the Other, which Levinas places at the heart of his reflections on the ethical. The author then shows that this divergence also accounts for the way in which Blanchot reads Levinas's notions of Judaism, God and the Messiah. Finally, the author shows how a redeveloped notion of virtuosity might give rise to a practice in which the capture of our ability to speak is challenged at the level of our interpersonal relations. The author uses Blanchot's reflections on the events of May 1968 as an example of the way in which we might ""affirm the break"" such virtuosity or messianism constitutes.",Art | Computer science | Database | Divergence (linguistics) | Epistemology | Interpersonal communication | Judaism | Linguistics | Literature | Messiah | Messianism | Philosophy | Psychoanalysis | Psychology | Reading (process) | Relation (database) | Social science | Sociology | Theology,https://openalex.org/W2016143100,1.0,,OpenAlex,9

The fragments that make up this collection reveal four meanings that can be unfolded according to this logical order: 1) “désastre” recalls the passage “from the closed world to the infinite universe” (A. Koyré) driven by modern astronomy and philosophy against a humanity that believed itself at the center of everything; 2) “désastre” is akin to Derridean deconstruction: an iconoclastic re-reading of texts. It perverts the Hegelian dialectic: neither negation of “astre” nor promise of a reconciling synthesis; 3) “désastre” is the object, or subject, of an “écriture,” synonymous with a poetic fragment, radicalizing a turning point in Blanchot’s work. Rather than the German Romantics, the rapprochement here is with Nietzsche; 4) this fragmentary turning point obeys a double necessity: on the historical side, “désastre” evokes the yellow star of the Jew discredited; on the biographical side, Blanchot refers to psychoanalysis for the first time with such insistence, especially in the fragment entitled “(Une scène primitive ?).” Disaster is a paradoxical experience that moves from “du catastrophique ou du tragique” to “quelque chose qui s’est passé sans être présent.”",Art | Philosophy,https://openalex.org/W3047422217,0.0,,OpenAlex,9
10.2979/victorianstudies.59.1.14,,David Kurnick,,2016,2016-01-01,Victorian Studies,,article,en,False,"Reviewed by: Communities in Fiction by J. Hillis Miller David Kurnick (bio) Communities in Fiction, by J. Hillis Miller; pp. xiii + 333. New York: Fordham University Press, 2015, $95.00, $30.00 paper. There's no avoiding the word: the critical voice that animates J. Hillis Miller's latest book (his thirty-second) is chatty. To be sure, the author of Communities in Fiction has access to Jacques Derrida's computer files, and his text is thick with references to Maurice Blanchot, Paul de Man, Jean-Luc Nancy, and other heavy-hitters of post-structuralist thought. But he's not trying to intimidate us: for every reference to Heideggerian Dasein, the reader encounters an observation that, say, the always-becalmed Bay of Sulaco in Joseph Conrad's Nostromo (1904) is ""a little spooky, if you think of it,"" or that the issue of what order undergirds the visible world in Virginia Woolf's novels is ""the big question, all right,"" or that Thomas Hardy's vision of character is ""somewhat weird"" (157, 239, 104). His one-word commentary on the ironic subtitle of Conrad's The Secret Agent: A Simple Tale (1907): ""Ha!"" (207). This book's secret subtitle might be Table Talk of a Deconstructionist. Miller has clearly crafted this laid-back, (faux?)-naif persona as a matter of critical principle. ""I advocate in the strongest terms what I call a double reading of novels,"" he writes in the book's most explicit methodological statement. ""In one reading you give yourself, heart and soul, without reservation to reading the novel. . . . The second reading should be performed, impossibly, at the same time. This is the interrogative one, the suspicious one. It is the reading in which you investigate how the magic is performed"" (18). Miller's casual style suits this critical program well: it allows him to tell us, for example, that he takes Hardy's invented Egdon Heath ""straight"" enough to wonder how much its tight-knit community has in common with ""Deer Isle, Maine, where I now live most of the year,"" and to confess that Anthony Trollope's novels make him cry (126, 89). But this informal voice also delivers Miller's insights into the rhetorical structure undergirding these reality effects, as when he notes offhandedly that Hardy's The Return of the Native (1878) uses metaphors drawn from landscape to describe characters' faces and metaphors drawn from human faces to describe landscapes, in a ""constant linguistic coming and going"" that should—but miraculously doesn't—undermine our sense of the narrated world's solidity (94). Similarly, while his interpretation of one of Miguel de Cervantes's Exemplary Novels (1613) takes its bearings from Derrida's late seminars on the animal, Miller's intransigently anti-humanist conclusion is phrased in the most genial of terms: ""It is a story about a couple of really nice talking dogs"" (303). Miller's critical voice is a surprisingly supple tool for having it both ways—for basking in the magic of textual illusion even as he tries to see through it. Such casualness extends to the book's construction. Communities in Fiction is essentially a series of close readings of six texts: Trollope's The Last Chronicle of Barset (1867), [End Page 127] Hardy's Native, Conrad's Nostromo, Woolf's The Waves (1931), Thomas Pynchon's early story ""The Secret Integration"" (1964), and Cervantes's ""The Dogs' Colloquy"" in Exemplary Novels. As this series suggests, the book has an eccentric relation to Victorian literature per se, and in fact the book's last full chapter ends with the remark that ""definitions of period styles in literature, and even period names in literary history generally, are highly problematic"" (307). The book's titular rubric organizes the argument only in the loosest sense, and Miller frequently has to remind the reader, in the midst of an engaging tangent about the difficulties of taking notes in an electronic book or the Supreme Court's recent gutting of the Voting Rights Act, that he is coming back to the topic of fictional communities.

Sarah Hammerschlag explores this figure of the from its prewar usage to its resuscitation by Jean-Paul Sartre, Emmanuel Levinas, Maurice Blanchot, and Jacques Derrida. Sartre and Levinas idealized the Jew's rootlessness in order to rethink the foundations of political identity. Blanchot and Derrida, in turn, used the figure of the to call into question the very nature of group identification.

The place of Blanchot in Lacoue-Labarthe's thought was both discreet and profound, involving difficult, agonizing questions about the status of literature, the implications of which are steeped in political and ethical stakes. Ranking alongside the works of better-known interlocutors for Lacoue-Labarthe's thinking such as Plato, Hölderlin, Nietzsche, Benjamin, or Heidegger, Blanchot's writings represent a decisive crossroads of almost all of Lacoue-Labarthe's central concerns. The latter converge here on the question of literature and, in particular, of literature as the question of myth–in this instance, the myth of the writer born of the autobiographical experience of death, a myth with which Lacoue-Labarthe himself had to contend, namely through his experience of reading–and writing after–Maurice Blanchot. But the issues at stake in this encounter are not merely (auto)biographical; they entail a relentless struggle with processes of figuration and mythicization inherited from the age-old concept of mimesis and to which all Western literature is subject. As this volume demonstrates, the originality of Blanchot's thought lies in its problematic but obstinate deconstruction of precisely such processes. In addition to offering unique, challenging readings of Blanchot's writings, setting them among a variety of key texts by writers and thinkers as diverse as Montaigne, Rousseau, Freud, Winnicott, Artaud, Bataille, Lacan, Malraux, Leclaire, or Derrida, this translation further familiarizes English-speaking audiences with Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe's groundbreaking work and, as such, with contemporary debates in French thought, criticism, and aesthetics.",History | Psychology,https://openalex.org/W4239382153,2.0,,"Crossref, OpenAlex",9

Premodern biblical cultures found in the scene of abortive flight a monitory sign of improvident curiosity and rooted inhospitality.

The book’s cumulative perspective identifies Lot’s wife as the resilient figure of vigilant dwelling between the substantialist dream of resemblance and the mutating dynamism of otherness.

The author shows how obligation emerges at the conjuncture of competing claims: between the other’s subject affirmation and one’s own dislocation, between what one has and what one has to give, between a demand that asks for too much and the extraordinary demand of asking nothing. In the unfolding and reiteration of themes issuing from the other’s claim upon oneself develops a complex picture of the tensions that sustain the scene of ethical relationality. Just how these tensions both subtend and undercut an other-centered ethics of preservation is the question this book tarries with. By proposing a way to read the distinct ethical charge of the other’s claim not to be harmed, <italic>Decreation and the Ethical Bind</italic> offers a novel treatment of the concept of decreation in the thought of Simone Weil, putting her work in dialogue with Emmanuel Levinas, Maurice Blanchot and Judith Butler. In examining themes of ethical obligation, vulnerability and the force of weak speech, the present study places Weil within a continental tradition of literary theory in which writing and speech are bound up with questions of ethical appeal. It contributes a new and critical voice to the current conversation in theory and criticism that addresses a difficult form of ethics that isn’t grounded in subjective agency and narrative fruition, but in the risks taken to fulfill the claims it makes.",Agency (philosophy) | Appeal | Communication | Computer science | Conversation | Criticism | Epistemology | Harm | Law | Library science | Linguistics | Narrative | Nothing | Obligation | Philosophy | Political science | Sociology | Subject (documents),https://openalex.org/W2622787059,9.0,,OpenAlex,9

The book's horizon is ethics in the Levinasian sense: the question of the other, which, on the hither side of language understood as a system of signs and of representation, must be welcomed by language and preserved in its alterity. Martin Heidegger's elucidation of a more essential understanding of Being entails a deconstruction of onto-theology, of the sign and the grammatical and logical determinations of language, all decisive starting points for Levinas and Blanchot. At stake for both Levinas and Blanchot is how to mark a nondiscursive excess within discourse without erasing or reducing it. How should one read and write the other in the same without reducing the other to the same? Critics in recent years have discussed an ""ethical moment or turn"" characterized by the other's irruption into the order of discourse. The other becomes a true crossroads of disciplines, since it affects several aspects of discourse: the constitution of the subject, the status of knowledge, the nature of representation, and what that representation represses.

Para reflexionar sobre esta intuicion, seran relevantes, entre otros filosofos y poetas, autores como Jacques Derrida y su concepto de imposibilidad dentro del contexto de la deconstruccion, Maurice Blanchot y su concepto de desastre y Emmanuel Levinas y su pensamiento sobre el Hay como lugar de la afirmacion impersonal, una palabra-imagen que nos sirve para entender la poetica de Rivera desde la ausencia de una mismidad reductora de lo infinitamente otro. Para alcanzar esta ausencia, requisito de una escritura de la acogida, quien escribe, muere, “encuentra su muerte como abismo” [1] , nos dice Blanchot. Es asi como Rivera constantemente se borra al escribir, su poetica es un transitar por esta experiencia, es poetica de la apertura y del afuera, una invencion de lo imposible. Esta imposibilidad es entendida, siguiendo la idea del filosofo Jacques Derrida, como la venida de aquello que no es previsto con anterioridad al encuentro, porque el poeta al morir en su escritura deja que toda posibilidad de proyectarse a si mismo en la representacion de lo creado se anule y solo pueda ser creado lo que no posee un horizonte de espera. Siguiendo esta misma linea de reflexion, llegaremos a la problematizacion de Dios que hace Ximena Rivera. Un ser que, al igual que el poeta, crea desde una intencionalidad irreductible, acogiendo lo infinitamente otro desde su ausencia de mismidad o de divinidad, como diria la filosofa Simone Weil. Todo este trabajo nos llevara a entender, finalmente, que la poesia de Rivera es la busqueda de una experiencia ligada a lo sagrado y a lo divino.

10.5325/complitstudies.55.4.0953,Jugalbandi,Ranjan Ghosh,,2018,2018-12-01,Comparative Literature Studies,,article,en,False,"“Let us space”—Derrida1 Caught amidst the wonderful circulation of ideas raised in this Forum—astute, probing, reflective, critical—I somewhat struggle to find my dwelling in the across: the metaphor for dialogue, the dialogue for communication, the communication for “thinking.” It is the investigation to locate dialogue in Thinking Literature across Continents (TLAC) that creates dialogue: the “dialogism” building around the loss, inconspicuity, the emergence, and the mute presence of dialogue across the book. If Laurent Dubreil hits the key of “incommensurability,” accenting the creation of conversation without creating the conditions for what we understand as dialogue, Andrew Way Leong strikes the note of dialogue in what he sees as the “fourth book” which is “neither-Ghosh-nor-Miller.” When Nicholas Royle looks for “thinking,” R. Radhakrishnan and Ragini Tharoor Srinivasan introspectively debate the “connect” and “disconnect” of a Ghosh–Miller dialogue that is absent, present, and absent–present in the same breath. Radhakrishnan laments missing more common ground; Marshall Brown sees a silent dissensus propelling the project forward and Ragini identifies communication in incommensurability: is dialogue all about exchanges only? Or can dialogue form out of an apparent lack of exchanges and the possible worlds that it generates or ungrounds?Ragini's observation—“It is enough that Ghosh and Miller desire dialogue; they desire the across”—is a good point to begin from. I like the loaded implication in Judith Butler's ascription of literature as “terrifying”: “What is literature for me? Does that mean my definition? Does it mean how does literature live or work for me? All these are terrifying questions.”2 If this “terrifying” connects with literature's inherent uncanny and ambiguity then we can with some measure rescribe the “across.” Allow me here to think for a while with Martin Heidegger. If being becomes “a real distress and a real liberation”3 how can the distress and liberation be effected and explored in the being of world literature, Viswa Sahitya? The question that at once inspires and bemuses me is what constitutes such a “being” and whether the being is explicable and accessible to enunciation. Heidegger's history of being leads us to rethink the “obvious” and this “obviousness rethought” can be the premise to begin thinking about world literature. If finding a text in a remote recess of a culture and rescripting its presence within the predominant circulation of the literary marketplace becomes an agenda that world literature is usually seen to promote, there is manifest profit in working through the obvious; this allows the unconcealment of truth to contribute to our thinking of the literary. How can world literature work through the “obvious”? What would it be, or it is, or be with?The obvious carries a “presence” with it, a kind of attainment which does not always pitch on the methodologies or protocols of reading. It has a pervading and pervasive history which most thinking on/around world literature has failed to acknowledge. World literature formations are not always conditioned and calculative; the obvious corresponds with the meditative, the truth of the unconditioned and the undogmatic. The obvious in world literature is what I see as the real standoff with the status quo of reception. What, then, can we interrogate in literature when there is a world prefixed to it? How does that open the world of literature, the being of literature? Knowing literature is, often, knowing the limits of questioning literature which does not mean knowing the points of exhaustion; rather, a reminder of our inability to question further. It is here that my understanding of the “across” changes and I start to engage with Ragini's query: “Reading across: Is it even possible to read in any other way?” The world being of literature is to question the conditions of knowledge generation; it tries to see literature as “existing,” as a phenomenon whose truths await to be discovered and are not always imputed and constructed. The truths of such findings lead us to see the “fundamental” of world literature where the fundamental is not merely about what “is there” but what essentially survives our investigation. This brings us to question the finitude of literature as performance and act: if Heidegger has inspired us to question the very role and dynamic of metaphysics in our thinking and understanding of life, I prefer to extend this to our thinking of both the world, literature and the world of literature. If every move, gesture, act, and performance comes with historicity as has been the idealized narrative of expectation and fulfilment in Western cultures, we are missing some part of the world that literature ungrounds and something that “world literature,” as I see, has not been able to realize.Interestingly, my introduction of the word “sahitya” (without the italics) in TLAC has met with an intriguing panorama of responses. In fact, the use of the word sahitya in its original Sanskritic context lacks the “fundamentals” that I have been arguing for. If world literature, through a technology of thinking, permits and promotes certain protocols and procedures of doing and performing, it can also make allowance for certain unmapped categories and experiences. Here world literature confronts its own “poetic”; this is not merely the uncanny but a nonappropriative relation to the being of literature. Is not there a way to understand literature nontheoretically? Admittedly, this builds an “across” that escapes a method and obviates a method after one has built a connection with the text. Thinking with Heidegger, I call this the unconditioned across, the across that is more fundamental than we ever could think out; it has its own tribunal of reason. I claim the power of the “ordinary” and the “obvious” in a text and extend the notion of the “across,” as exemplified in TLAC, through terms that are more fundamental, associative, preconditioned, prereflective and, hence, less settled in the “said” than in the “saying.” What I mean is that all understanding is not theory; some understandings “happen,” not necessarily awaiting to be theoreticized and “technologized.” Understandings can be potentials, “out of condition” thinking, and mere empathetic responses also. This, however, need not be confused with the aesthetics of “excess” and lack, the surplus and suture.Working through Heidegger's idea of the world then we encounter a space which is “unintended” and present in an “unprominent way,” somewhat outside the conscious formalization of understanding and thought. Following on that, we may argue that the “literary” is in world literature and exists in the world of literature. So what stares back at us is the articulative difference between world literature and what is “out there” in the world of literature: representation and constructivism need not always find their way in the ways of the world of literature. Is world literature both being-in-world and “attunement” (Stimmung), an always already across that shows up its own mattering and is not always a part of theoria? In fact, my trans(in)fusion takes advantage of this Heideggerean reading to work through “representations” and “correspondences” and a world-hood which is impossible to evade and live without. The world of literature is “there”; but world literature is, mostly, reductionist. Before we see a text as belonging to a culture, a particular background, a relational context, and a timescape—the analysands that help put the whole structure together—the world of literature precedes our reductive experience counterintuitively. This, for me, contributes to how we see world literature, presenting and “presencing” its formation not in isolation or apartness but by living holistically; this is the “opening forth.” If the prereflective and prediscursive experiences are pressed into play then the dasein of literature works around a “poetic” where mattering and presencing oppose the tyranny of the theoretical. So what kind of truth are we exposed to? This brings us to the “imperative” to understand the experience and truth of “uncoveredness”; for instance, more than what Samuel Coleridge says or represents, we vector toward what unconceals Coleridge, the world of Coleridge, the obvious Coleridge, his being-in-the-world: this is not what Coleridge does or can be theorized about and, hence, reduced to explanatory parts and his own constructivism but the Coleridge as an existing being that has always been on attendance upon aletheia. We uncover Coleridge (technized) as much as Coleridge is always attending an unconcealment and “openedness.” So would it be wrong to say that the world of literature determines world literature? Sahitya is “present,” always caught in the “clearing,” un-worlded; it cannot be without norms, forms and doxa; but sahitya cannot also be without the being when the poetic is seen to work at both levels—the discursive and the prereflective, the mode and the mattering. Here I see sahitya as a philosophy and art getting released from several misconstruals that TLAC could not escape suffering from.The literary, I would like to argue, awaits to be rescued from literature. So are we to infer saying that in the “resistance of the literary” against the prospective subsummation under the protocols and logic of reading and reception that one sees the development of the valence and variety of the across? Interestingly, the postliterary need not be seen as a concept or a space to pursue or serve; the postliterary is an experience that resists calcifications within certain subsets of philosophy, metaphysics, criticism, and aesthetics; it is strictly not a deconstructive space either. The poetic of the postliterary is always an other to itself where creativity is an opening up without ignoring the Open that is at once intrinsic to it and is also separated from it. So the world of world literature exists as the Open. The postliterary then is often the Heideggerean Earth for me: radical, subversive, contributory, resistant, withdrawn, romantic—a truth and a part of a truth that is conditioned and unconditioned at the same time.Brown, quite appropriately, embeds dialogue in—“Reading around, beneath, across, through.” So on a separate “plateau” I indulge my “across factor” (read dialogue-factor, if you like) for a while by thinking with Gilles Deleuze. Thinking is about creating problems: Deleuze sees it as creating difference. So our encounters with world literature/visva sahitya through Deleuze do have to be on the performatics of worlding. Perhaps the Deluezian contribution to our thinking of world literature comes from thinking “outside” structures that go to make literature in particular and world literature in general. This thinking outside structures is comparing structures and producing structures—initiating difference and seeing difference emerging on its own. It speaks of the unconditioned “fundamentals” of the phenomena of literature which is what constitutes the being of the prefix: the world, the visva. This brings me to argue how world literature can live out of literature and develop its correspondences (our dialogue) with mathematics, politics, religion, sciences, and other issues and disciplines. It is an “act of thought,” the untimely reason of structuration and structuring. World literature can be the pretext and the occasion to release the “reason” from our doing of humanities—a liberation of reason from critical thinking. It promises both difference and the advent of reasonableness.If thinking literature is becoming literature does the “literary” stay as an image of something, a phenomenon, or a flow? The literary, for me, is not always about a phenomena or an image owing itself to a structure, an idea, and a foundation. The literary is not always a theory to be read and experienced; it exists as a question, as a difference effecting “thousand plateaus” to our understanding; the literary, then, is, often, annoyance, a con-text. Deleuze was for shock affected through literature; in fact trans(in)fusion budgets for it too. To put it differently, transfiguration as across comes to us not from what we have and how we do; it promotes a singularity that literature does not engage with but is made to engage with. The literary must urge us to think what thinking can possibly do. Can across be interpreted as a possibility of producing the life of thinking and the literary? Is across the very possibility of “difference”? Then if “across” becomes tamely synonymous with transdisciplinarity, thinking becomes ossified into an academic discipline. I would like to change the tenor of across here with Deleuze by qualifying it as “power”: generously tempted again to ask whether across serves life and does not merely become a mere functional principle for greater transcultural payoffs. If the way in which I have argued “across” in TLAC demonstrate, on occasions, a conceived or preconceived doing and motivation, this across, thinking with Deleuze, gives me a sense of change as a happening analogous to the happening of life and the emergent power thereof. It is this across which is my “poetic” between philosophy and literature—not necessarily the poetic that produces thought but that which allows and clears the space for thinking. I agree that I proposed “across” in TLAC with already an image of across and, hence, disallowed, to an extent, the “power” of the literary. I tried to build a fresh power but possibly could not unconceal another dimension of the across caught somewhere within constellative formations. Trans(in)fusion connects better with the “life” and “power” that Deleuze talks about. My proffering of “concepts”—like trans-habit—produces a direction in thought formations, in the entangled power of the literary; but, I agree, we need an extension, a rearticulation, that might aggravate the power of interpretation that trans-habit proposes. I shall argue on this line to see trans-habit as the expression of the obvious, the fundamental to our very modes and ontology of thinking. Trans-habit, in such a reading, is both an orientation, a process, a happening, a conceptual modality, and a Deleuzian power.In a way, I would like to see the postliterary and its welcoming disability to subscribe to a norm and form as a Nietschean happiness—an “active” motion which stylizes thinking: the postliterary as “intensities.” Trans(in)fusion is less a concept and more an experience; experiences can be our ways of life. The across factor in trans(in)fusion comes often as an affect. Is the postliterary—what I have argued in my chapter on the ethics of literature in TLAC—the “becoming aesthetic”? It is both cultural and acultural, historical and ahistorical: not meaning what has been set to mean, not meaning what agreeability would have us believe, not meaning what exhaustion of meaning would reach us to. The postliterary would know how to make no noise and yet be a bustling metropolis.Is staying across then meant to be a jugalbandi which, etymologically, refers to “entwined twins”? Staying across means the jugalbandi where both perform as lead actors keeping a play in between; it evokes a performance where both stand in the frame and yet know that they have their game to play and pursue. Among many forms of jugalbandi in Indian classical music the Jasrangi (credited to Pandit Jasraj) is eminently innovative. Here a male and a female vocalist sing “two different ragas at the same time in two different scales, based on the Moorchhana principle of Indian classical music. The two singers give prominence to the Shadja-Madhyam and Shadja-Pancham Bhav, in which the ‘ma’ note of the female voice becoming the ‘sa’ of the male voice, and the male ‘pa’ becoming the female ‘sa’. Since both the singers sing in their own pitch the tonal quality in the music is not lost.”4 Jasraj explains that he devised the duet “like the yin and the yang, or Shiv-Shakti.” The Jasrangi is a sensuous fusion of the Purush (male) and the Prakiti (Female), harmonious blend wherein the male and female singer, each with individual accompaniments, sing different ragas at their own respective scales, interweaving them into a wondrous whole.”5 Hillis and I thought and wrote in our own pitch, in two different voices—the Anglo-American contrasted with the trans(in)fusionist—where my pitching on theory is Hillis's accent on the text and the rhetoric, where dialogue is not often eased out but is teased out of differences and particularities: the jugalbandi is in the apparent incommensurability. I cannot agree more with Brown when he argues that “the dissensus that shapes a dialogue keeps both authors on track towards opening new world … Ghosh articulates the aspirations; Miller outlines method.” TLAC has a different music to offer. Jugalbandi, as it connects with sahitya, then, complicates the bond and the binding. Where are the boundary and the release in the bandi? How singular is the jugal and how can one twinize the singularity?Sometimes, more than dialogue, this becomes a dialogue in progress; “not happening” as “yet to happen.” Not all exchanges I admit have their “daylight.” There is a “murmur” to every chapteral progression. Hillis and I spoke and if “speaking across” did not find many points of conspicuous connect, the speaking itself created its own narrative of cross-communication. For me, this is Leong's not Ghosh-not Hillis book: the book that one might, under the cover of Maurice Blanchot argue, as the “still to come,” the book getting written in the speaking: “He did not know her very well. But he did not need familiarity to get close to other beings. Was chance, which had assigned him to this particular room, responsible for their becoming so intimately involved with each other?”6 We came together by “chance,” have waived at each other ever since, need not require familiarity to get closer, did not need much daylight to make sense of our days: it has not prevented speaking despite others being allowed to occupy spaces in between. Continents are not always built through crossings; looking back at each other, a conversational emblem and gesture and even waiving points of contact can construct continents. Jasrangi Jugalbandi is singing where one need not know the other well enough; but a performance that knows how it can form a “hotel room” meant for sojourns without erasing the vector of travelling. It is not a home where rest and settlement can set in. TLAC sees us in a hotel room to stay without forgetting to travel when the stay is meant to provide a break from travelling. The game of across can be seriously interrogated on this note of hospitality.The across discussed in such a range does not make “Me” confine itself to Hillis only. My understanding of across in the book and in the present pages of this essay render the “You” beyond “grammatical thinking”: not just “symphilosophizing” partners, but a redoing of the “I” whose investments are mostly directed to stray away from a unitary principle of system philosophy: “The very event of dialogue is therefore a concrete site of nonidentity between I and you. To speak and to listen to another is to recognize the underivable singularity and novelty of the other who may always surprise me with her perspective, objection, or silence. The other of dialogue is not an a priori category of knowledge, which I already possess, but rather a mystery that continually dispossesses me in the direction of the unknown and the unknowable.”7 Hillis and I dialogued our past with a singularity, dialogued ourselves, left certain spaces tantalizingly close to the conventional dialogue zone and kept resonances that transcended dialogic conventions and principles; often, we did not dialogue at all. If Miller has advocated world literature, Ranjan Ghosh has, through his “intra-active transculturality,” argued for “more than global”; if Miller has brought Wallace Stevens and metaphor, Ghosh has brought Robert Frost, and the Sanskrit and Chinese interpretations of metaphor. I do not think there was a nonengagement here; rather, a relational process that transcreated a space beyond what system-dialogues or a point-counterpoint commentating would allow. Was this the “distance of proximity”? Is this what I have argued elsewhere, to quote the physicist Abner Shimony, the “passion at a distance”?8In fact, this spirit of jugalbandi stands to inform how we do comparative/world literature. It is where gradient, pitching, spacing, and rhythm and scale matter: a complicated understanding of these units make for a fraught lease of life for sahitya. My “shameless” enthusiasm here inspires me to see kire-tsuzuki (cut-continuity)—an interesting paradigm in Japanese aesthetics—as a way of explaining this dialogue-syndrome in this book. Hillis and I are “cut” off from each other through our background, training, orientation, preferences, and style; but the cut was the way to find our voice of communication; the cut inspired continuity in that correspondence across issues emerged from the cut-zones of our initiation, the premises of emergence and takeoffs. The Japanese notion of ikebana is a good explanatory point: ikebana means “making flowers alive” which ironically happens after the flowers are cut from the plants. As Nishitani Keiji points out that this “cut” is what lets the “true nature of the flower come to the fore.”9 Flowers cut find their “home” in flowers arranged: the cut contributing to their emergence within a separate aesthetic premise. The flower in its two states of existence—in the plant and cut off from the plant—builds its own aesthetic and correspondence. Can we then argue for a fresh dialogical poetics supervening the cut? The dialogical event is about letting my roots be challenged, to let something else flower, hitting at the radical roots of impermanence with which most concepts exist and find their lives. Scholars from across the continents can claim a cut, a severance from how they understand literature within their “homely” background of reception; the cut becomes the space to understand the transience and travelling-differential of concepts and ideas; the cut unconceals the sacred of sahitya. It is not merely the awareness of the cut but the ontological necessity of the cut that transcultural poetics must learn to evolve with—the cut-continuation, I say, somewhat in mootness, the kire-tsuzuki in world literature studies.A common sound that then fills the pages of this Forum is the contemplative and performative exuberance that I bring into this book: Leong sees “an inundative series of references” where “Ghosh's (in)fusion tends to immerse us within wave-like, or oceanic, economies of excess and supplementarity”; if Miller's orientation is inductive, Leong claims that Ghosh's (in)fusion approach reads to him as “profoundly un-ductive.” Brown rightly sees an overflowing “enthusiasm” in Ghosh; he, in perceptive elegance, points out that “Ghosh's stylistic excesses preach and practice trans-reading not just across but beyond continents … He feels, and communicates, excitement rather than shame.” So when Brown sees me as someone who “dazzles” I take to it with a politics of trying to see sahitya as restive, of consciously thinking “shamelessly aloud,” risking thinking with a view to expand the domains of literary neighborhoods. Dialogue, then, need not involve two anthropogenic interlocutors for I claim to have built some annoyance and unease through my “exhilaration” which Brown finds inspirational, considers as “extreme fusion” of “omnivorous multilingualism” and “impassioned” drive “to reach beyond—‘far beyond’—crossing barriers and forging links.” Dialogue, as one might note, is built in an across that shoots through the exhilarative restlessness of thoughts and references; here, the grammatology and geometry of thinking is more about how my shamelessness of referential immersion stokes strands of dialogue among characters as disparate as Deleuze and Tagore or rasa theory and Heidegger. If such a “thinking” annoys, then, annoyance is the inspiration to locate the dialogue not between Hillis and Ghosh but in the Ghosh whose irony of survival is not in sojourning a continent but in subterfuge, in perverse restivity, in the shamelessness that he could not find a home.Have I not found a home?And, if I have, has my finding been chiasmatized by a loss?Does the confusion over my identity—a postcolonial, Indian, not Indian, more than Indian, perhaps, a deconstructionist—show how I impersonate the dialogue?I relish being caught in the across, on the edge of chaos, dithering around my identity.I am (the) dialogue.The jugalbandi can begin here, too.",Ascription | Biology | Common ground | Communication | Computer science | Computer security | Conversation | Dilemma | Ecology | Epistemology | Key (lock) | Linguistics | Metaphor | Miller | Philosophy | Sociology | Space (punctuation),https://openalex.org/W4250161189,7.0,,OpenAlex,9
10.5325/jmedirelicult.48.1.0102,Arts of Dying: Literature and Finitude in Medieval England,Wendy A. Matlock,,2022,2022-01-01,The Journal of Medieval Religious Cultures,,article,en,False,"D. Vance Smith states succinctly the central thesis of his new book Arts of Dying: Literature and Finitude in Medieval England: “literature and dying are inextricably linked” (4). Summarizing it effectively is more challenging. Let me begin by describing Smith's definitions of “literature” and “dying.” Smith views literature through a formalist lens as a self-contained mode of language, though like a deconstructionist, he asserts that meaning is indeterminate and unity deferred (5). He differentiates “literature” from theology and philosophy, noting it is “neither a prayer nor a proposition” (1). However, Smith approaches the second term “dying” with a philosopher's subtlety. He incorporates ideas from Aristotle to Derrida, but Maurice Blanchot and Gillian Rose on the language of dying and Theodor Adorno and Edward Said on late style are especially influential. Dying, as Smith conceives of it, is not death; rather, it “lies between life and death” and is “a movement toward something, an aspect of the unfolding of time” (5, 22). What literature and dying share, then, is uncertainty and engagement with the illogical and transsensory amid external constraints. Covering English literature from the tenth through the fifteenth centuries, Arts of Dying demonstrates that literature, like dying, is never complete, always open for interpretation, and that medieval thinking about finitude is more complex than the endless mourning characteristic of postmodern philosophy. “No medieval subject” could have embraced boundless despair, Smith insists, because teaching about transcendence endowed dying with “deep responsibility” (4). Incisive close readings of primary sources make each chapter compelling on its own, but as a whole, Arts of Dying beautifully and profoundly meditates on that responsibility.The book's twelve chapters are divided into three chronological sections that Smith describes as cultural moments oriented toward different metaphors: the emerging soul in Old English; entering a crypt in the fourteenth century; and being dispersed into an archive in the fifteenth (2–3, 6). The three chapters in part one consider the speaking soul and are the most diffuse. The first chapter after the introduction begins with Hamlet, Caesar, Clark Kent, and Roger Bacon but contends writers like Augustine and Boethius recognized the impossibility of speaking about the dead, and late medieval philosophers, including Abelard and the Oxford Calculators, were preoccupied with the problem in their theories of language and reference (20). Chapters 2 and 3 focus on Old English texts that, Smith says, construct the body as “the corpse of language” and ask what happens when “there is speech without a body” (32).The second section contains the book's most important insights. The six chapters offer astute readings of Middle English poems where the corpse in a crypt parallels enigmatic literature. Chapter 4's dazzling study of the four-line lyric “Erþe toc of erþe erþe wyþ woh” [Earth took of earth earth with woe] unpacks the poem's suspension “between the semantic permissiveness of logic and the strict and literal jealousy of grammar” (76). The next two chapters discuss Chaucer. Chapter 5 unexpectedly and productively pairs The Book of the Duchess and the Pardoner's Tale to argue that death makes poetry possible through its deferral, but efforts to represent death fail spiritually and literally. Chapter 6 locates irony in the Knight's inability to provide an alternative to the Monk's string of tragedies, a failure that Smith maintains stems from his misreading of The Consolation of Philosophy. The seventh chapter traces the word “pestilence” through Piers Plowman and details Langland's revisions to the figure of Trajan in the B and C texts to show how “the search for terms, for the precise and permanent naming of things” is “an unending and infinite enterprise” (151). The virtuoso analysis of Pearl in chapter 8 suggests that “the awful finitude of the grave” shadows the poem's “compulsive aestheticizing of experience” (153). In chapter 9, the second section's central metaphor of the crypt is most developed as Smith uses the obscurity of the mysterious tomb whose discovery animates St. Erkenwald to explore the alterity of death in the face of ongoing dying.Part Three focuses on usable archives and appropriately studies three named poets: John Lydgate, Thomas Hoccleve, and John Audelay. Chapter 10 demonstrates that Lydgate's Fall of Princes and Troy Book turn Chaucer's concept of tragedy into an archive by prioritizing communal memory. In chapter 11, Smith argues that Hoccleve's Series epitomizes how the second postpandemic generation sought to make public the moment of dying. The final chapter (there is no conclusion) reads John Audelay's The Three Living and the Three Dead in light of Audelay's work as a chantry priest, demonstrating that the poem unites close reading and prayers for the dead. As a whole, this final section persuasively counters the common stereotype of a fifteenth century obsessed with representing catastrophic death, since as Smith shows, “death was already catastrophic, difficult to comprehend, before the Black Death” (215).The book does exhibit some editorial weaknesses. Its organization highlights an underdeveloped historicist argument. Even after rereading the book, I find Smith's three moments difficult to nail down. More connections between the chapters in each part would help to differentiate the three metaphors, and more attention to their cultural moments would clarify the history. Other concerns include a structural inconsistency—the table of contents lists three chapters in the first section devoted to “Soul,” but the introduction says it covers two, and the subtitle appears before chapter 1 (VII, 2, 11)—and erratic translation practices. The default seems to be to provide Modern English translations for all foreign language quotations, but occasionally the original is presented alone. Despite these quibbles, Arts of Dying amply rewards careful reading.Ultimately, the book attests to how medieval literature merits study for what it can tell us about the human experience. Arts of Dying demonstrates the importance of history “not just as the object of undirected nostalgia, but precisely because the past is something that becomes difficult for us to understand, even to endure” (46). Equally important is the timeliness of this volume. The preface, written during national mental health month in 2019, acknowledges Smith's mental illness, encouraging career-minded academics to prioritize their own health and asking administrators to help erase the stigma of therapy. The April 2020 publication date corresponds to early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, and, read alongside works like David Coley's Death and the Pearl Maiden and Elizabeth Outka's The Influenza Pandemic and Interwar Literature (both 2019), it seems almost prescient. Certainly, Arts of Dying deserves to be read in that context, but also to be revisited when our experiences of catastrophic death tolls are less immediate.",Art | Classics | History | Law | New england | Political science | Politics | The arts | Visual arts,https://openalex.org/W4210266875,2.0,,OpenAlex,9

Instead of focusing on the Maenads’ vitalistic rage, I linger on an apparently problematic scene: the enactment of Dionysian transgender rituals by two old men, Tiresias and Cadmus. Their jouissance lies in a gratifying passivity before the imminence that, for Blanchot, is dis-aster. In this scene, a prolonged present provoked by a not-yet-materialized catastrophic present evokes the temporality of the “gimmick,” which, for Sianne Ngai, confronts us with “a mode of bad contemporaneity akin to an elongated present.” I dwell on the temporality of hesitation as an alternative that Bacchae offers to the manic claims of decision-making and the future. While waiting is at once an unwelcome intrusion in the Covid era and the perennial condition of the migrants and refugees denied coevalness, in the context of the play the “arrival” (venir) of a “lack” (a-) constituted by the act of waiting and the in-decision of the present’s immobility has the potential to forestall the deceptively liberating future of ecstatic Dionysian time, replacing it with an extended (differently) Dionysian chronicity.",History | Philosophy,https://openalex.org/W4406959352,0.0,,OpenAlex,9

While elements of his work share with Levinas and Heidegger a problematic privileging of the human, Blanchot nevertheless offers the basis of what might be seen as a timely ‘deeper ecological’ thinking, one that can engage the destructive anthropocentrism of Western thought and tradition in the very minutiae of its literary and philosophical texts. Unlike in much ‘green’ philosophy, no concept of nature or earth serves as foundation for Blanchot's thought. He is engaged by the ‘impossible’ as that which is not a matter of human power or decision, affirmed in both its ethical force and its contestation of dominant and appropriative conceptions of knowledge, rationality and invention. A comparison is offered between Max Oelschlager's representative ecocritical essay ‘Earth-Talk: Conservation and Ecology’, with its romantic attempt to find and celebrate modes of unalienated or ‘natural’ language, and Blanchot's practice of what can be seen as a more radical and questioning ‘ecology’ based on almost opposite conceptions.",Anthropocentrism | Archaeology | Biology | Ecology | Environmental ethics | Epistemology | History | Natural (archaeology) | Philosophy | Physics | Power (physics) | Psychoanalysis | Psychology | Quantum mechanics | Rationality | Romance | Sociology,https://openalex.org/W2157500968,3.0,,"Crossref, OpenAlex",9

,"Political Writings, 1953-1993",Maurice Blanchot,,2010,2010-09-04,,,book,en,,"Maurice Blanchot is a towering yet enigmatic figure in twentieth-century French thought. A lifelong friend of Levinas, he had a major influence on Foucault, Derrida, Nancy, and many others. Both his fiction and his criticism played a determining role in how postwar French philosophy was written, especially in its intense concern with the question of writing as such. Never an academic, he published most of his critical work in periodicals and led a highly private life. Yet his writing included an often underestimated public and political dimension.This posthumously published volume collects his political writings from 1953 to 1993, from the French-Algerian War and the mass movements of May 1968 to postwar debates about the Shoah and beyond. A large number of the essays, letters, and fragments it contains were written anonymously and signed collectively, often in response to current events. The extensive editorial work done for the original French edition makes a major contribution to our understanding of Blanchot's work.The political stances Blanchot adopts are always complicated by the possibility that political thought remains forever to be discovered. He reminds us throughout his writings both how facile and how hard it is to refuse established forms of authority.The topics he addresses range from the right to insubordination in the French-Algerian War to the construction of the Berlin Wall and repression in Eastern Europe; from the mass movements of 1968 to personal responses to revelations about Heidegger, Levinas, and Robert Antelme, among others.When read together, these pieces form a testament to what political writing could be: not merely writing about the political or politicizing the written word, but unalterably transforming the singular authority of the writer and his signature.",Politics | Criticism | The Holocaust | Literature | History | Classics | Law | Political science | Art,https://openalex.org/W586279101,5.0,,OpenAlex,9
,Mutual Implications Otherness in Theory and John Berryman's Poetry of Loss,Elias Schwieler,,2003,2003-01-01,,,article,en,,"This thesis examines John Berryman’s poetry of loss together with four different theoretical perspectives. It is the purpose of the study to involve Berryman’s poetry and critical theory in a dialogue which attempts to break down the hierarchy that positions theory as the subject and literature or poetry as the object of study. Instead, by focusing on the otherness of each discourse, that is, what could be called the unconscious of Berryman’s poetry of loss and the language of theory, poetry and theory can be seen to presuppose and mutually imply each other. Those of Berryman’s poems mainly analyzed in the thesis, and which could be called his poetry of loss are “The Ball Poem,” Homage to Mistress Bradstreet, and The Dream Songs. The four theoretical perspectives consist of Martin Heidegger’s thinking concerning the word and concept departure, David S. Reynolds’s notion of the subversive in the American Renaissance, Nicolas Abraham’s psychoanalytical concept anasemia, and Maurice Blanchot’s theory of death and poetry in his book The Space of Literature. The theoretical base of the thesis is developed primarily from Shoshana Felman’s “To open the question,” an editorial introduction to a special issue of Yale French Studies entitled Literature and Psychoanalysis.

The analysis of the destruction of the Twin Towers in chapter one of Retort's Afflicted Powers: Capital and Spectacle in a New Age of War (London: Verso, 2005) would also be another place to engage with recent debates on the politics of the image. 4 Maurice Blanchot, ‘Two Versions of the Imaginary’, The Space of Literature, trans. Ann Smock (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1982). 5 Gregg M. Horowitz's approach, as seen in a book such as his Sustaining Loss: Art and Mournful Life (California: Stanford University Press, 2001), might be described as philosophical materialism (a materialism informed by Hegel, Marx and Adorno). By contrast, and following on from his writing on the parasite and the body's relation to parasitic guests, Phillipson's text gestures towards the organ-less body of the image-as-event in a way that deliberately invokes Deleuzian themes. In an effort to indicate a different form of becoming, Phillipson's text itself, through its poeticizing form, opens onto new types of relations (new compound words, new possibilities of configuring space), and new forms of immanence. See In Modernity's Wake: The Ameurunculus Letters (Routledge, 1989), or his text Ars Universitas: Jon Thompson's Ricinullus Fragments (John Hansard Gallery, 1985) with its discussion of parasitic agency. 6 In distinction to Hegel, the dialectic set in motion by Stezaker's ‘negation’ of the image generates a more infernal or mysterious series of associative relations. It is closer, in certain respects, to what Jacques Rancière calls, paraphrasing Jean Luc-Godard, the ability of the image to generate a ‘fraternity of metaphors’. See Rancière's ‘Politics of Aesthetics’ in Aesthetics and its Discontents, trans. Steven Corcoran (Oxford: Polity Press, 2009), p.58. 7 For Michael Newman's other writing on Blanchot and the image, see ‘The Trace of Trauma: Blindness, Testimony and the Gaze in Blanchot and Derrida’ in Maurice Blanchot: The Demand of Writing, ed. Carolyn Bailey Gill (London: Routldege, 1996). 8 As Timothy Clark suggests in ‘Blanchot and the End of Nature’, Blanchot's account of the image has often been ‘presented in negative and even slightly lugubrious terms’ (see p.26). For Clark's other writing on imagination and inspiration, see his The Theory of Inspiration (Manchester and New York: Manchester University Press, 1997). 9 Alphonso Lingis' essay can be seen as a bridge between his more recent writing, such as Abuses (Berkeley and London: University of California Press, 1994) and Foreign Bodies (New York: Routledge, 1994), and his work as one of the key translators of Emmanuel Levinas' texts (including, significantly, Levinas' essay on the image, ‘Reality and its Shadow’, published in The Levinas Reader, ed. Seán Hand (Oxford: Blackwell, 1989)). 10 ‘A History of the Human Voice’ is distinct from the opening text ‘Baby or Doll?’ where the story's narrator/witness becomes fixated on trying to recount to his therapist his traumatic confusion between the life and death of a child. The traumatic confusion in ‘Baby or Doll?’ mimics, in certain respects, the abyssal relationship in Blanchot's corpse-as-image. 11 For further information about Édouard-Léon Scott de Martinville's work, and mp3 recordings of the decoded soot covered paper, see the web page: < http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/44267/title/Earliest_known_sound_recordings_revealed> [accessed 10 December 2009].",Art | Art history | Epistemology | Hegelianism | Kindness | Law | Philosophy | Political science | Politics | Psychoanalysis | Psychology | Sociology | Spectacle | The Imaginary | Theology,https://openalex.org/W4232890418,0.0,,OpenAlex,9

Pascale-Anne Brault and Michael Naas (Stanford, California: Stanford University Press, 1999), pp.33-4 3 Jacques Derrida, Of Grammatology [1967], trans. Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak (Baltimore and London: John Hopkins University Press, 1997), p.61. Here Derrida explicitly affirms the methodical necessity of the transcendental research. It is necessary to be faithful to phenomenology, at least up to a certain point. And precisely there where, on the way of the transcendental research, one finds arche-writing as the universal structure and irreducible condition of experience. At this point, the opposition transcendental/empirical unfolds itself as an effect of the iterable trace, of the elaboration of the ideality from the irreducible conditions of experience and not its cause. Then, the opposition comes to be un-founded while there is the possibility of a phenomenological research, which is effectively immanent to experience and no longer related to the metaphysics of the transcendental meaning. In this perspective Derrida uses the term quasi-transcendental to distinguish his transcendental research from metaphysics. On transcendental research and universal structures of experience see Rodolphe Gasché, The Tain of Mirror (Harvard: Harvard University Press, 1986). On the notion of ‘quasi-transcendental’ see Geoffrey Bennington, ‘Derridabase’, in Geoffrey Bennington and Jacques Derrida, Derrida [1991] (Chicago: Chicago University Press, 1993). 4 This perspective is developed in particular in Jacques Derrida, ‘Faith and Knowledge: the two Sources of “Religion” at the Limits of Reason alone’[1996], in Acts of Religion, trans. Samuel Weber and ed. Gil Anidjar (New York and London: Routledge, 2002). 5 Jacques Derrida, Demeure, p.29. 6 Jacques Derrida, Demeure, p.32. 7 Jacques Derrida, Demeure, p.33. 8 See Jacques Derrida, Edmund Husserl's Origin of Geometry: an Introduction [1963], trans.

Allison (Evanston: Northwestern University Press, 1973). I refer to the deconstruction of phenomenology in my reading of testimony: Francesco Vitale, ‘Let the Witness speak: from Arche-writing to the Community to-come’, in Derrida Today, 2:2, 2009. I account for the ethical and political effects of the quasi-transcendental structure of arche-writing. Now it is time to explore the description of this structure through the experience of literature. 9 For the reference to this structure see Jacques Derrida, Demeure, p.40: ‘What is indispensable, even for a witness who does not know how to write, in the common and trivial sense of the word, is that he be capable of inscribing, tracing, repeating, remembering, performing, the acts of synthesis that writing is. Thus he needs some writing power, at the very least, some possibility of tracing or imprinting in a given element [élément quelconque]’. 10 Jacques Derrida, Demeure, p.41. 11 In this perspective it is possible to find in Derrida's late work the trace of a research on the transcendental performative touching upon the notions of responsibility, friendship, promise, testimony, oath and, in particular, trust and faith (freed from the sacer). 12 Maurice Blanchot, The Writing of the Disaster [1980], trans. A. Smock (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1986), p.41. 13 Jacques Derrida, Demeure, p.49. 14 Maurice Blanchot, The Writing of the Disaster, p.65. 15 Jacques Derrida, Edmund Husserl's Origin of Geometry: an Introduction, p.86: ‘Before the “same” is recognized and communicated among several individuals, it is recognized and communicated within the individual consciousness: after quick and transitory evidence, after a finite and passive retention vanishes, its sense can be re-produced as the “same” in the act of recollection; its sense has not returned to nothingness. In this coincidence of identity, ideality is announced as such and in general in an egological subject. […] Thus, before being the ideality of an identical object for other subjects, sense is this ideality for other moments of the same subject in a certain way, therefore, intersubjectivity is first the non-empirical relation of Ego to Ego, of my present to other presents as such; i.e. as others and as presents (as past presents). Intersubjectivity is the relation of an absolute origin to other absolute origins, which are always my own, despite their radical alterity.

Derrida, Writing and Difference [1967], trans. A. Bass (London and New York: Routledge) p.253: ‘No doubt life protects itself by repetition, trace, différance. But we must be wary of this formulation: there is no life present at first which would then come to protect, postpone, or reserve itself in différance. The latter constitutes the essence of life. Or rather: as différance is not an essence, as it is not anything, it is not life, if Being is determined as ousia, presence, essence/existence, substance or subject. Life must be thought of as trace before Being may be determined as presence. This is the only condition on which we can say that life is death, that repetition and the beyond of the pleasure principle are native and congenital to that which they transgress [original emphasis]’. 19 Jacques Derrida, Demeure, p.95.",Art | Art history | Différance | Epistemology | Law | Literature | Metaphysics | Opposition (politics) | Philosophy | Political science | Politics | Theology | Transcendental number,https://openalex.org/W1987683140,1.0,,OpenAlex,9

Even a cursory look at the main notions that have shaped such trends – the recognition of the translator's inescapable visibility and agency, the transformational character of translation, the role of translation in processes of colonisation and evangelisation, the relationship between translation and gender issues, just to name a few – will show that they are deeply indebted to key concepts borrowed from Nietzsche's philosophy, particularly as it has been rediscovered by twentieth-century thinkers such as Jacques Derrida, Gilles Deleuze, Roland Barthes, Maurice Blanchot, and Michel Foucault. In fact, if we consider, for example, that mainstream conceptions of the 'original' and its idealised relationship with translation are still very much reminiscent of Plato's theory of Forms and its devaluation of representations, it becomes evident how fundamental Nietzsche's conceptions of language, interpretation, and the will to power have been for the ways in which we now think of the task of translators and the ethics that should guide their work. After briefly covering Nietzsche's comments on the topic and after introducing the main theoretical questions that are relevant for an evaluation of his role in the development of contemporary translation studies, particularly as one of the key figures often associated with the emergence of poststructuralism, deconstruction, and postmodern thought in general, I will concentrate on the few texts on translation theory that explicitly address Nietzsche's thought.",Philosophy,https://openalex.org/W4253482838,0.0,,OpenAlex,9

Having always been exposed to criticism for performing unworldly readings, blurring real and political problems, and using theoretical jargon with no practical consequences, deconstruction is now considered an obsolete style of approaching literary texts. More than two decades after the death of Jacques Derrida (1930-2004), the most prominent philosopher of deconstruction, this article questions the assumed tension between theory and praxis in the studies of Comparative Literature. It argues that problematizing the structure of representation, as Comparative Literature scholar Christopher Fynsk (b. 1952) suggested, has practical consequences in the long run. Departing from Fynsk’s ideas and engaging in the relevant thoughts of Maurice Blanchot (1907-2003) and Jean-Luc Nancy (1940-2001), who inspired Fynsk considerably, the article aims to show that carrying the studies of different literatures beyond thematic analyses may constitute an important phase in the dislocation of common sense. The possibility of such a dislocation might enable Comparative Literature to dwell in the world with a renewed attention to the different meanings of the shared existence of the human. Therefore, the article suggests, deconstructive pedagogy, calling for a literary turn, with the emphasis on the conceptual thinking that undermines presuppositions, might still be an important component of Comparative Literature education.",Aesthetics | Art | Comparative literature | Cultural turn | Deconstruction (building) | Engineering | Epistemology | Linguistics | Literature | Pedagogy | Philosophy | Psychology | Social science | Sociology | Waste management,https://openalex.org/W4411792417,0.0,,OpenAlex,9

In this article, I trouble the role of ethics in our literary practices of reading and writing the autobiographical by complicating what can be considered as autobiographical 'truth' and 'evidence' in conjunction with Jacques Derrida's deconstruction of the ethical. Drawing on the writings of Maurice Blanchot, mediated by the thinking of Derrida, I discuss ethical possibilities for thinking the humanity of others within literary practices as implicated by the ethical question that confronts the reader and writer of the so-called autobiography. Using the example of Maurice Blanchot's text The Instant of My Death, I challenge the literary institution to examine vigilantly the implicit assumptions and discourses underlying our canonised reading and writing acts. Such a re-examination, I argue, has implications not only for literary critical practices but also for education in the humanities as such.

The key question Cixous's work seeks to answer is how to appropriate an identity that is not clearly defined for her. Jewishness creates a form of lack within identity, something that cannot be said or thought directly. This is why Cixous needs to play with words that evoke Jewishness, to generate a linguistic disorder designed to write something for which there are no words.

As Bruns demonstrates, the difficulty of much modern and contemporary poetry can be summarized in the idea that a poem is made of words, not of any of the things that we use words to produce: meanings, concepts, propositions, narratives, or expressions of feeling. Many modernist poets have argued that in poetry language is no longer a form of mediation but a reality to be explored and experienced in its own right.",Poetry | Philosophy | Modernism (music) | Narrative | Philosophy and literature | Feeling | Mediation | Literature | Art history | Epistemology | Art | Aesthetics | Sociology | Social science | Linguistics,https://openalex.org/W3191618290,1.0,,OpenAlex,9

,An Ethical Model in a Postmodern Faust: The Daemonic Parody of the Politics of Friendship in Thomas Mann's Doctor Faustus,Roland A. Champagne,,2000,2000-09-22,Style,,article,en,,"Dysfunctional has become ethical and political dilemma in postmodernity. In dysfunctional nature of friendship, strangeness is a crucial factor. This strangeness is recognition of alterity and lack of relationship of otherness to self. In this regard, two survivors of Holocaust offer cogent commentaries. Emmanuel Levinas describes ethics as face-to-face response toward other (1986) while survives within Hannah Arendt's insight that every single person needs to be reconciled to a world into which [s]he was born a and in which, to extent of his distinct uniqueness, [s]he always remains a stranger (Essays 308). Arendt's experience after 1933 was that an abyss had opened to reveal the disloyalty of friends (14). Hence, role of had to be revaluated in face of catastrophe of Holocaust. Levinas was and continues to be a major voice in this reevaluation of since Holocaust. With inspiration from his ethic al writings, we can portray as a response to call of other in a deliberate attempt to bridge void between self and other. Despite these voices, some contemporary theorists maintain that is still problematic in postmodernity. Jacques Derrida, who himself is strongly influenced by Levinas (Adieu), submits a volume often essays (Politics) telling us about cogency of Montaigne's sixteenth-century outcry: Oh my friends, there is no friend. Meanwhile, though Maurice Blanchot rhapsodizes about his ethical friendship with Levinas (Writing; Friendship), his political flirtations with Fascism during 1930s (Bident) are problematic. Because dysfunctional is becoming more and more of a pattern in postmodernity, we need more examples of exceptional that can be unique and that can make friend functional. The intersection of Arendt's and Thomas Mann's works provides opportunities to situate in this manner. On one hand, Arendt was a perceptive political theorist whose essays have been generally concerned with loss of human freedom in political governance. She prefers political writings of Plato to Aristotle and sees crucial dilemma as placing at center stage the typically Socratic question What is friendship? (Life 101). Of course, problem is how to answer question. She often positioned her discussions of as ethical comfort within conflicts of a politically charged milieu. For this reason, Arendt's writings have become a lively subject of discussion in France. From her adaptation of Jean-Jacques Rousseau's role of compassion as a moral and political principle, Arendt is portrayed by one of her astute French translators, Sylvie Courtine-Denamy, as asking questions about place of ethics and generosity in politics (241). [1] Since Aristotle, who claimed in his Nicomacheon Ethics that the science for good of man is politics (300), relative positioning of ethics and has been debated. But this positioning of as crucial ethical problem for is also unsaid problem in writings of Thomas Mann, Arendt's fellow native German who like her came to United States in aftermath of Nazi debacle. Both Arendt and Mann used their writings as arenas in which to dramatize struggle for role of ethics after their departure from their homeland in face of great political evil. Both had written prior to their emigration from Germany. But departure from their homeland made them portray differently in their writings. While Arendt was primarily a political theorist who used principles of ethics and philosophy to engage her contemporaries in debates about human governance, Mann portrayed great struggle between aesthetics and ethics and seemed to ignore centrality of political struggles o f his characters to obtain control over their lives. …",Friendship | Postmodernity | Politics | The Holocaust | Psychoanalysis | Philosophy | Postmodernism | Alterity | Sociology | Aesthetics | Literature | Epistemology | Law | Theology | Psychology | Art | Social science | Political science,https://openalex.org/W1581444646,1.0,,OpenAlex,9

This intervention also appears as a post-face to Derrida's 2003 edition of Parages, his collection of essays devoted to the work of Blanchot. In this article, I examine Derrida's affinity to the work of Blanchot, as the one whose work 'stood watch over and around what matters to me, for a long time behind me and forever still before me' (The Beast and the Sovereign, Volume II, p. 176). In doing so I look at the manner in which Derrida engaged with Blanchot in his work and how in examining this engagement another reading of sovereignty emerges, one which is not tethered to liberal models of sovereign will but one which eludes biopolitical ordering and may be seen as a form of disappearance. Through a reading of Derrida's readings of Blanchot's The Madness of the Day I emphasize the link of this alternative sovereignty to both writing and literature in order to demonstrate how a more radical thinking of sovereignty can be discovered in Derrida's thought.",Sovereignty | Reading (process) | nobody | Order (exchange) | Philosophy | Deconstruction (building) | Literature | Law | Politics | Political science | Art | Computer science | Economics | Linguistics | Engineering | Finance | Waste management | Operating system,https://openalex.org/W2185423948,0.0,,OpenAlex,9

Through a reading of Henry Garnet's 'A Treatise of Equivocation' (1595), I argue that it is in this attempted displacement of the truth that equivocation reveals its terrorist potential. Accordingly, late-sixteenth and early-seventeenth century discourses on equivocation are read here in relation to early-modern literary theory to figure equivocation as an irruption of the poetic within the language of law. In making this argument, Garnet's Treatise and the literary-theoretical work of Francis Bacon, George Puttenham and Philip Sidney are read alongside the work of J. L. Austin, Maurice Blanchot, Jacques Derrida, Immanuel Kant and Jean-François Lyotard in order to pursue a reading of lying, literature and metaphor that locates the challenge to authority posed by equivocation in its evocation of the performative aspect of truth-telling.

Funk (Evanston: Northwestern UP, 1973) 292–95. 3 The earliest use of ""phenomenology"" in religion that I have been able to find occurs in Pierre Daniël Chantepie de la Saussaye's ""Phänomenologischer Theil"" which appeared in his Sammlung Theologischer Lehrbücher: Religionsgeschichte (Freiburg i. B: Mohr (Siebeck), 1887–89), Erster Band, sects. 9–27.

Thomas A. Carlson (Evanston: Northwestern UP, 1998). I leave aside Marion's earlier work, partly phenomenological and partly theological, in which he seeks to approach God without using the language of being. See God without Being: Hors-Texte, trans.

Jeffrey Bloechl (New York: Fordham UP, 2000) 224. It is unclear exactly how to weight the influence of Barth on Marion, although some influence, perhaps by way of Hans Urs von Balthasar, is evident. 15 See Jean-Luc Marion, In Excess: Studies of Saturated Phenomena, trans. Robyn Horner and Vincent Berraud (New York: Fordham UP, 2002) 26, 50. 16 See Marion, Being Given, sect. 24. 17 See Jacques Derrida's remarks in ""On the Gift: A Discussion between Jacques Derrida and Jean-Luc Marion"" in God, the Gift, and Postmodernism, ed.

Hering anticipated Janicaud's concerns when he noted that phenomenology might well be abused for religious reasons. See his Phénoménologie et philosophie religieuse 73–74. Marion rejects the criticism in Being Given 5, 234. The source of the initial claim would seem to be Marion's talk of God coming to us as a divine gift. See his God without Being: Hors Texte, trans. Thomaas A. Carlson, foreword David Tracy (Chicago: U of Chicago P, 1991) 3. 18 Marion, Being Given 5. 19 Ibid. 115. 20 Ibid. 5, trans. slightly altered. In the second edition of Étant donné (1998), Marion writes ""Révélation"" in both sentences and not ""révélation"" in the second. 21 Avery Dulles proposes several senses of ""revelation"": as doctrine, as history, as inner experience, as dialectical presence, and as new awareness. Revelation as inner experience and as new awareness might not have any significant public dimension until proclaimed. See his Models of Revelation (New York: Doubleday, 1983), part I. 22 See Marion, ""Le Possible et la révélation"" in Le Visible et le révélé (Paris: Cerf, 2005) 14. The essay first appeared in 1992, and it is here that the notion of the saturated phenomenon is announced. 23 Marion, Being Given 215. Counter-experience is not restricted to divine revelation, however; it occurs whenever there is a saturated phenomenon. See Marion's essay ""The Banality of Saturation"" in Counter-Experiences: Reading Jean-Luc Marion, ed. Kevin Hart (Notre Dame: Notre Dame UP, 2006). For Blanchot's sense of experience, see my The Dark Gaze: Maurice Blanchot and the Sacred (Chicago: U of Chicago P, 2004), chapter 5. 24 See Marion, Being Given 235; Aristotle, Metaphysics IX, 1049b; and Heidegger, Being and Time, trans. John Macquarrie and Edward Robinson (Oxford: Blackwell, 1973), para. 7, 63 (38), para. 31, 183 (144). 25 See Henry, ""Quatre principes de la phénoménologie,"" Phénoménologie de la vie, 4 vols., I: De la phénoménologie (Paris: PUF, 2003); and Marion, Being Given: Towards a Phenomenology of Givenness, trans. Jeffrey L. Kosky (Stanford: Stanford UP, 2002). 26 See, in particular, Henry's books I am the Truth: Toward a Philosophy of Christianity, trans. Susan Emmanuel (Stanford: Stanford UP, 2003); Incarnation: Une philosophie de la chair (Paris: Seuil, 2000); and Paroles du Christ (Paris: Seuil, 2002). The heavy emphasis on the Johannine Christ in the first of the trilogy is relaxed somewhat by the third. 27 See Henry, Paroles du Christ 8, 127. See also ""Material Phenomenology and Language (or, Pathos and Language),"" trans. Leonard Lawlor, Continental Philosophy Review 32 (1999): 343–65. 28 For a quite extreme example, see John C. O'Neil, Who Did Jesus Think He Was? (Leiden: Brill, 1995). It should be noted that Henry does not hesitate to talk in phenomenological terms of the binatarian life of the Father and the Son. See I am the Truth 92. 29 See Henry, Incarnation 37; and I am the Truth 23. 30 Heidegger, Being and Time 58. 31 See Heidegger, Four Seminars, trans. Andrew Mitchell and François Raffoul (Bloomington: Indiana UP, 2003) 80. It must be noted that Henry tends to overstate the newness of non-intentional phenomenology. While Henry's originality is not to be doubted, one can see the beginnings of non-intentional phenomenology in Husserl. See, in particular, his On the Phenomenology of the Consciousness of Internal Time (1893–1917), Collected Works, IV, trans. John Barnett Brough (Boston: Kluwer, 1991), sect. 39; and Analyses Concerning Passive and Active Syntheses: Lectures on Transcendental Logic, Collected Works, IX, trans. Anthony J. Steinbock (Boston: Kluwer, 2001), sect. 23. 32 Husserl, Psychological and Transcendental Phenomenology and the Confrontation with Heidegger (1927–1931), Collected Works, VI, trans. and ed. Thomas Sheehan and Richard E. Palmer (Boston: Kluwer, 1997) 218. See also Otherwise than Being or Beyond Essence, trans. Alphonso Lingis (The Hague: Nijhoff, 1981) 131. 33 See Henry, ""Phénoménologie de la vie,"" De la phénoménologie 61. 34 See Henry, I am the Truth 10. 35 Henry originally argued that religion is concerned with ""the immediate consciousness of Being."" His later reflections on Christianity do not use the language of Being at all. See his The Essence of Manifestation, trans. Girard Etzkorn (The Hague: Nijhoff, 1973) 405. 36 Consider the following passage, for example, taken from Fichte's fifth lecture of his The Doctrine of Religion: ""God enters into us in his actual, true, and immediate LIFE; or, to express it more strictly, we ourselves are this his immediate Life. But we are not conscious of this immediate Divine Life …"" The Popular Works of Johann Gottlieb Fichte, trans. William Smith, 2 vols.

John D. Jones (Milwaukee: Marquette UP, 1980) 173. 38 See Levinas, Totality and Infinity: An Essay on Exteriority, trans. Alphonso Lingis (The Hague: Nijhoff, 1979) 40. At his first meeting of Le Colloque des intellectuels juifs de langue française Levinas ventured to say, in the discussion following Edmond Fleg's paper, that Judaism is not a religion. See ""Sens de l'histoire juive"" in La Conscience juive (Paris: PUF, 1962) no. 1, 15–16. When Levinas decides to use the word ""religion,"" as he does in a study of Rosenzweig read at the second meeting of the Colloque in 1959, he uses it in the prescriptive sense of devotion to the other person. Religion, for Rosenzweig and as accepted by Levinas, ""is totally different from [the view of religion] that secularism combats."" ""'Between Two Words'"" in Difficult Freedom: Essays on Judaism, trans. Seán Hand (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins UP, 1990) 187. See, in particular, the discussion following this paper in La Conscience juive no. 1, 148. 39 See Levinas, ""The Ruin of Representation"" in Discovering Existence with Husserl, trans. Richard A. Cohen and Michael B. Smith (Evanston: Northwestern UP, 1998) 121. See also Franz Brentano, Psychology from an Empirical Standpoint, trans. A.C. Rancurello, D.B. Terrell and L.L.

Elizabeth Haldane and G.R.T. Ross, 2 vols. (Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 1972) I: 166. See also Levinas, ""Philosophy and the Idea of Infinity"" in Collected Philosophical Papers, trans. Alphonso Lingis (The Hague: Nijhoff, 1987) 54. 41 See Berdyaev's comments in Jean Wahl, Existence humaine et transcendance (Neuchatel: Éditions de la Bacconière, 1944) 129; Levinas, Totality and Infinity 48; Descartes, ""Meditation III"" in The Philosophical Works of Descartes I: 166. 42 See Henri Bergson, Time and Free Will, trans. F.L. Pogson (London: Macmillan, 1950). 43 Levinas, Otherwise than Being 88. 44 Vasily Grossman, Life and Fate, trans. and intro. Robert Chandler (New York: New York Review of Books, 2006) 407–08. 45 See Derrida, ""Violence and Metaphysics,"" Writing and Difference, trans. Alan Bass (London: Routledge, 1978) 111. 46 See Levinas, Otherwise than Being 160, 163. 47 For Levinas, liberalism would require an a priori commitment to the equality of all persons, and would therefore be inconsistent with a primary affirmation of the transcendence of the other person. This is not to say, of course, that Levinas does not recognize the value of liberalism in Western societies. 48 As Derrida remarks in a parenthetical comment, Levinas's ethics are ""nothing less than Schelerian."" See his ""Violence and Metaphysics"" 98. Does this mean that, for Derrida, Scheler also concerns himself with an ""Ethics of Ethics"" or that Levinas does adopt a first-order moral position from time to time? Derrida does not say. Levinas talks of giving the other priority over the self as the sole ""absolute value"" in ""Philosophy, Justice, and Love,"" trans. Michael B. Smith, in Is it Righteous to Be? Interviews with Emmanuel Levinas, ed. Jill Robbins (Stanford: Stanford UP, 2001) 170. I allude in the passage in the body of the text to Max Scheler's introductory remarks on non-formal ethics of values in his Formalism in Ethics and Non-Formal Ethics of Values 6–7. 49 See Levinas, ""Reality has Weight,"" trans. Alin Cristian and Bettina Bergo, Is it Righteous to Be? 163. See also Immanuel Kant, Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals, trans. H.J. Paton (New York: Harper, 1964) 96. 50 See Hermann Cohen, Religion of Reason: Out of the Sources of Judaism, trans. and introd. Simon Kaplan (Atlanta: Scholars, 1995). A covert influence of Moses Mendelsshon, especially his Jerusalem oder über religiöse Macht und Judentum (1783), is also possible. 51 See Levinas, Of God Who Comes to Mind, trans. Bettina Bergo (Stanford: Stanford UP, 1998). 52 See Levinas, Otherwise than Being 149. 53 Levinas, Of God Who Comes to Mind xi. 54 See Levinas, Otherwise than Being, chapter 5, 1, 2; and ""Truth of Disclosure and Truth of Testimony,"" Basic Philosophical Writings, ed.

Garrett Green (Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 1978), sect. 13. In one respect Levinas is closer to Fichte than to Kant. Unlike Kant, Fichte offers no re-description of Christianity by way of practice, belief and church, and one finds no similar attempt to re-describe the whole of Judaism on the basis of Levinas's model of revelation. 56 Franz Rosenzweig, The Star of Redemption, trans. Barbara E. Galli (Madison: U of Wisconsin P, 2005) 18. See Levinas's comments in ""Philosophy, Justice, and Love"" 173. 57 See Levinas, ""Revelation in the Jewish Tradition,"" Beyond the Verse: Talmudic Readings and Lectures, trans. Gary D. Mole (Bloomington: Indiana UP, 1994) 149–50. 58 On the distinction between happening and occurring, see Derrida, ""A Witness Forever"" in Nowhere without No: In Memory of Maurice Blanchot, ed. Kevin Hart (Sydney: Vagabond, 2003) 48. 59 See Levinas, ""Prayer without Demand"" in The Levinas Reader, ed. Seán Hand (Oxford: Blackwell, 1989) 227–34. 60 Harold Bloom has performed the great service of making the writings of the Jahwist strange for us once again. See his The Book of J (New York: Grove Weidenfeld, 1990), which contains a retranslation of the Jahwist texts by David Rosenberg. 61 See Levinas, ""Foreword"" in Beyond the Verse: Talmudic Readings and Lectures, trans. Gary D. Mole (Bloomington: Indiana UP, 1994) x. Deontologizing, as I am using the word here, differs from demythologizing to the extent that, on Levinas's understanding, the saying inexorably leads to the said, the realm of ontology, even though the said can be unsaid. 62 In the ""Foreword"" to Beyond the Verse Levinas identifies Descartes's infinite with God. Elsewhere, though, he distinguishes the structure of transcendence it bespeaks from God. 63 René Descartes, ""Reply to Objections, V"" in The Philosophical Works of Descartes, trans. Elizabeth S. Haldane and G.R.T. Ross, 2 vols. (Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 1970) II: 218. 64 Henry could cite, however, Matthew 10.39, Mark 9.43 and Luke 12.23 and 14.26. 65 On the relations between Henry and Gnosticism, see Jad Hatem, Le savoir et les viscères de l'être: Sur le gnosticisme et Michel Henry (Paris: L'Hamattan, 2004). 66 See Joseph Donceel, ed., A Maréchal Reader (New York: Herder, 1970) 156. 67 See Marion, In Excess 52. 68 Aquinas, In duodecim libros Metaphysicorum Aristotelis Expositio, ed.

It is not Levinas complicated, often unstated philosophical disputations, nor his exhortatory style, nor even the originality of his argument that constitute the most formidable obstructions to his work today. On the contrary, the great-est difficulty today is the ease with which Levinas is arrogated, a facility that risks making him so accessible as to be wholly irrelevant. The ubiquity in contemporary intellectual circles of an ethics of the other leads, from ever diverse paths, directly to Levinas; and it is just this that prevents us from reading him well.",Argument (complex analysis) | Art | Art history | Biochemistry | Chemistry | Epistemology | Linguistics | Literature | Originality | Philosophy | Qualitative research | Reading (process) | Social science | Sociology | Style (visual arts),https://openalex.org/W3179944820,0.0,,OpenAlex,9

There are a number of ways in which this topic is taken up; however, I have not yet found a reading that deals explicitly with how both Nancy and Blanchot compare and contrast on this account. Bernasconi has cited a passage where Blanchot affirms society vis-à-vis community, which I will take up in the following section (see Bernasconi). And Gaon claims that Blanchot operates within this logic, while Nancy moves outside of it; however, Gaon's paper also tends to fuse Nancy's readings of community within the confines of this hypostasis as well (see Gaon). For an account of how Nancy attempts to move beyond this framework see Gratton; James, Fragmentary Demand; Lysaker, “On What is to be Done”; May; Norris; and Raffoul. For an account that mixes these two spheres in Nancy, in a hypostasis, see Devisch, “Trembling Voice,” “La ‘négativité sans emploi’” and “Entre crochets”; Domanov; Ingram; and Wagner. Finally, for a Nancean-inspired account of how this hypostasis works, see Lingis, esp. 155–57. 9 This is really an extension to number 3. For an account of Nancy's rejection of this formula see Devisch, “Trembling Voice”; Gratton; Ingram; James, Fragmentary Demand; MacKendrick; May; Norris; and Wagner. 10 It should be noted that Blanchot's The Unavowable Community was written as a response to Nancy's essay “The Inoperative Community” which appeared in Alea (Nancy, “La Communauté désœuvrée”). Nancy republished his essay, with minor revisions, along with other essays under the same title. I will be using the English translation of the latter essay (Nancy, Inoperative Community) because this version does not substantially deal with Blanchot's critique. As Bernasconi has noted, “Nancy did everything he could to reinforce the impression that Blanchot accepted his position on community” (Bernasconi 6). Also, this will be the only translated text that I am using for this paper. Blanchot's text, as well as Nancy's later responses, build upon a technical vocabulary which can be missed when translated into English, so I will work on my own translations. 11 This is a curt account of Nancy's fundamental criticisms of what he calls the foundational logos of modern Western notions of community. It should also be noted that when I speak of “traditional notions of community” I am reproducing Nancy's vocabulary, which is supposed to be directed solely towards Western metaphysical accounts of community. Further, one could problematize this homogenizing account of the modern Western notion of community as sovereign by looking at it from a historical perspective (see Bernasconi; Critchley; and Norris); however, I will leave this aspect open because I have chosen to focus on the hypostasis. 12 In this text, Nancy claims that this is an “ontological ‘sociality’” (ibid. 28). This should not be confused with “social ontology,” which some commentators have claimed (see Critchley; and Devisch, “Trembling Voice”). Raffoul has taken up this point by claiming that it is an “ontology of ‘the social’ that is more originary than any society, any individuality, and any essence of Being” (37). I will further outline this position later in this paper. 13 In Bernasconi's defence, his article was published in 1993 right around the time that Nancy was starting to reconsider his use of the death of the other and communication–both topics I consider further below. Plus, Blanchot had posited these two as hard alternatives. 14 It is important to note that Blanchot consistently refers to relations in the current society as “associated relations.” This is a common theme that spans Western social theory. It can be found in the direct translation of T önnies’ description of “gesellschaft,” Weber's “vergesellschaftung” (associative relationships), Rousseau's Social Contract, Parson's “ordering society,” Durkheim's “collective consciousness,” Marx's description of social relationships in Capitalism, Foucault's “disciplinary society,” and Simmel's “blasé attitude,” as well as multiple phenomenological accounts of relationships within the everyday world, such as Lingis's description of social relations (op. cit.), Husserl's “passive genesis” that occurs within the natural attitude, Heidegger's “das Man,” Sartre's “seriality,” Schutz's mundane “We-relationship,” and so on. 15 Using Bataille's last attempt to articulate the exigency of community, Blanchot points to the double imperative that shows up in making community said. The “tear” or exposure of the subject to the other is undone when the subject attempts to “communicate” this relation. These moments destroy each other. We find this reflexive moment within the economy of the Same, which results in a productivist notion of the “negative community” (see ibid. 40–45). This is simultaneously a critique of Nancy on the level of the hypostasis that occurs through language. 16 It should be noted that Levinas does not take this precaution in Totalité et infini. He does attempt to break free from the communist exigency, but he only does so by criticizing the adequation between the “common” with property, while privileging the “social.” The latter is represented in the third, which acts as a space between the self and the other (see Lévinas). As it will become apparent below, Levinas's manner of addressing relationships could be read as a reformulation of associative, hence societal, relations. 17 It should be noted that this minute passage contains the only explicit reference to Ricoeur that I have found in all the texts written by Nancy that have been cited in this paper. As I will show in this section, however, this single remark directs us towards an extremely important referential point in Nancy. So we should note that most of the following is my attempt to fill in the details of the relationship between Nancy's theory with Ricoeur's, including the way in which Nancy's moves beyond Ricoeur's. 18 Without going into the minute details of Nancy's ontological argument here, I should point out that in The Sense of the World Nancy claims that the “insofar as” should not be understood in a significative sense, but acknowledged insofar as it is a sense of “signifiance.” Signifiance “indicates an order or register anterior to the order of signification” (Nancy, Sense of the World 172, fn. 11). It opens up a “third way” of the touch that “ex-propriates” beings from the significative sense of the world. Is this a new hypostasis? Possibly, but it is not so in the sense of significative understanding that is thought from a stance underneath the object. Following Agamben, he also employs a non-objective language by saying that it points to a “whatever” (ibid. 72–74; Agamben). So it is outside of language or beyond the hypostasis of language. 19 This text contains both an English translation (23–41) and a German edition (85–106). I will refer to both as I have elected to retranslate some of the English version.",Art | Art history | George (robot) | History | Literature | Mythology | Philosophy,https://openalex.org/W1992256526,6.0,,OpenAlex,9
10.1080/10436928.2013.843118,Dead Letters: Richard Calder's Parable of Pornography,Russell Ford,,2013,2013-10-01,LIT Literature Interpretation Theory,,article,en,False,"Click to increase image sizeClick to decrease image size Notes In Enlightenment and Pathology: Sensibility in the Literature and Medicine of Eighteenth-Century France, Vila argues that the concept of “sensibility” served as a “conceptual metaphor” that, in part, was used by thinkers such as Rousseau and Tissot to argue that “the physical and moral realms of human existence were closely interrelated” (4). Laqueur's Solitary Sex: A Cultural History of Masturbation similarly shows that moral and physical health were inseparable for much of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Mason describes Calder's work as “an examination of post-human society through the mapping of Enlightenment male discourses of power and desire in opposition to new cyborg desires” (110). Latham describes the Dead trilogy (taken together with Calder's subsequent novel, Cytherea) as “the most potent popular-culture illustration to date of the critical power of the vampire-cyborg, the ability of this dialectical metaphor to capture at once the transformative longings and the binding limitations of capitalist consumer culture” (251). In “Finis” Derrida writes that the aporia “is a matter of what, in sum, appears to block our way or to separate us in the very place where it would no longer be possible to constitute a problem … There, in sum, in this place of aporia, there is no longer any problem” (12). In Calder's parable, the trajectory of Ignatz ends not in formulating and responding to a reframed problem of pornography but in precipitating the reader into an aporetic experience of the sexual other that has, to borrow from Jung, previously been hidden behind a projection. Derrida writes of aporetic experience that it “concerns the choice between the relation to an other who is its other (that is to say, an other that can be opposed in a couple) and the relation to a wholly, non-opposable, other, that is, an other that is no longer its other” (18). Fusing Derrida and Jung, Calder uses Ignatz to carry the reader to the point where sexual desire is experienced as a relation of responsibility to an other person who is wholly different from one's projected unconscious (collective or otherwise) fantasies. For instance, Melzer finds Calder's Dead Girls useful to feminist theory because it “poses questions of possible female posthuman subjectivities.” However, because she does not follow Calder's text beyond the first volume of his trilogy, she concludes that “his writing seems to join other cyberpunk fictions in their reinscription of Western narratives” (184, 216). Tatsumi links Calder's work to Donna Haraway's and argues that it is a kind of “cyborg-feminism” that depicts the “greatest potentiality of nanotech, or … picotech … to undermine the myriad ideologies of domination” (96). See, for instance, the discussion in Dead Girls where it is revealed that the desire-plague is the result of an attempt to retrieve a particular idealized past (99). “Conceptual persona” is Deleuze and Guattari's term for the emergent actuality of a philosophical concept, a literary tool that is used to work out (rather than represent) the creation of concepts. Importantly, a conceptual persona differs from a character insofar as the latter transmits concepts formed anterior to the text while the former is an instantiation of thought that acquires consistence only retroactively (61–83). The name Ignatz is drawn from two sources. The most obvious is the character Ignatz Mouse from the cartoon series Krazy Kat, known principally for returning Krazy's infatuation with a thrown brick. The other source is the puppeteer in Meyerink's The Golem. In a crucial scene, the narrator describes Zwakh's “simple life” as follows: “it suddenly seemed monstrous, even uncanny, that someone like him … should have suddenly returned to the shabby puppet booths and fairgrounds of his ancestors, putting the same puppets with which they had made their meager living through the same clumsy movements and acting out the same threadbare plots. I realized that he was unable to abandon them. They were part of his life, and when he was far away from them, they changed into thoughts which lodged in his mind and made him unsettled and restless until he returned home. That is why he looked after them so lovingly and proudly dressed them up in their tawdry finery” (57). Morganstern is a slightly altered form of the German “Morgenstern,” “morning star,” the German equivalent of “Lucifer.”. Calder repeatedly emphasizes pornography as a production of surfaces, a kind of theater without depth. Near the end of Dead Things, Lipstick says to Ignatz/Archangel, “You were a thing. Like me. I'm a thing too. A psychoid. We've both been willing players in the theater of cruelty” (377). By acquiring a history, Meta would cease to function as an ideology. For Althusser (who pays particular attention to the non-historical nature of ideology), ideology cannot have a history because the process by which individuals are interpellated as specific kinds of subjects by an imaginary narrative is eternal (127–86). In Calder's trilogy, the challenge for Ignatz is to attain an individuality not always already compromised by Meta's interpellation. Much like Calder, Levinas sees birth as a moment of radical or absolute discontinuity: “Both my own and non-mine, a possibility of myself but also a possibility of the other, of the Beloved, my future does not enter into the logical essence of the possible. The relation with such a future, irreducible to the power over possibles, we shall call fecundity” (267). Meta, the desire-plague of pornography, is a particular instantiation of the anima, the dramatic projection of the feminine aspect of the (collective) unconscious. To this projection is paired a masculine aspect, the animus, and Jung writes—in a passage that could just as easily be found in Calder's trilogy—“when animus and anima meet, the animus draws his sword of power and the anima ejects her poison of illusion and seduction” (15). In addition to these two aspects of the collective unconscious, Calder makes use of a third, the shadow. The shadow is an aspect of the psyche that consists of unrecognized negative emotion. The Jungian analytic process consists of a sort of individual recapitulation of the hero's descent into Hades, with the analysand first encountering and reconciling themselves with the shadow, or the personal unconscious, then passing on to a recognition of animus or anima, and then passing back up into consciousness. Calder's trilogy uses Ignatz as an affective vehicle (because the shadow is affective/emotional) to carry the reader into the Decadent anima and then back up into conscious life. Apokatastasis is a Christian term meaning “restitution,” or “restoration,” but that is sometimes used to mean “universal reconciliation.”. Maurice Blanchot describes the anonymous space opened by literature as one in which “[language] speaks, but without any beginning. It states, but does not refer back to something which is to be stated, something silent, like the meaning behind an expression, which would guarantee it” (Space 51). This space is one of hope, but not hope for a determinate future. “Hope is true hope insofar as it aspires to give us, in the future of a promise, what is. What is is presence. But hope is only hope. There is hope when, far from any present grasp, far from any immediate possession, it relates to what is always yet to come, and perhaps will never come; hope says the hoped-for coming of what exists as yet only in hope” (Infinite 41). Calder's trilogy concludes, at the end of a cascade of displacements both figurative and textual, with the invocation of a space that is not organized by an anterior desire. To conclude with a desire for a narrative world without pornography, in which desire is refashioned in some idealized way, would invite the return of the same sort of projected fantasies, would merely culminate in a new iconology. The lesson of Calder's parable is that pornography can be resisted only through the vigilant repetition of a virtual space that holds desire free for its actualizations. “The community of those who have nothing in common” is Lingis's title for his intervention in a discussion of community begun by Blanchot and continued by Nancy. Nancy, while largely sympathetic to Blanchot's contention that writing is able to clear the way for a community that is open to the radical possibilities of its constituents, argues against reifying the “hope” that Blanchot describes. “‘Literature,’ thought as the interruption of myth, merely communicates—in the sense that what it puts into play, sets to work and destines to unworking, is nothing but communication itself, the passage from one to another, the sharing of one by the other. What is at stake in literature is not just literature: in this, it is unlike myth, which communicates only itself, communicating its communion” (65). Nancy's emphasis on community stresses that writing is not the creation of a determinate community, but the sharing of a space that makes community possible.

,"Memorializing, allegory and the rewriting of Nathaniel Hawthorne",Rupert Holman,,1998,1998-01-01,,,dissertation,en,,"The thesis uses Hawthorne's interest in a scene of filial ambiguity, namely Samuel Johnson's penance to argue that Hawthorne's (re-) writing is characterised by a subversion of origins (both metaphysical and cultural). Complementing this argument, the thesis also attempts to show, with reference to texts by J. Hillis Miller, Jean-Francois Lyotard, Paul de Man and Maurice Blanchot, how deconstruction can offer new and important insights into Hawthorne's writing. Having outlined other important critical approaches (New Critical and New Historical) the thesis claims that, with its heightened sensitivity to the use of tropes, deconstruction is a particularly useful critical tool when it comes to reading Hawthorne. The thesis pays particularly close attention to two theoretical texts: Miller's Hawthorne and History: Defacing It and Lyotard's `Rewriting Modernity' and attempts to extend Miller's analysis (the only deconstructive text which refers directly to Hawthorne). This involves two movements. Firstly the thesis extends Miller's analysis by showing how it is echoed in the writings of de Man, Blanchot, and Lyotard. Secondly, the thesis refers to a wider selection of writings from Hawthorne's corpus (including writings from Twice-told Tales, Mosses From An Old Manse, The Snow-Image, `Alice Doane's Appeal', The Scarlet Letter, The Marble Faun, Our Old Home, the final `unfinished' manuscripts and diary and notebook entries). Using insights from these texts the thesis argues that Hawthorne rejects the idea that history involves the storing up of facts for future retrieval (a project which is aligned with memorialising). Hawthorne, it is argued, subverts this sense of memorialising by repeatedly drawing attention to an instability that contaminates each and every historical happening.",Miller | Subversion | Literature | Deconstruction (building) | Intertextuality | Modernity | Allegory | Metaphysics | Philosophy | New Criticism | Argument (complex analysis) | Criticism | Art | History | Literary criticism | Literary theory | Epistemology | Law | Ecology | Biochemistry | Chemistry | Politics | Political science | Biology,https://openalex.org/W1562384357,0.0,,OpenAlex,9

,"Towards a poetics of justice: Mystical theology, kenosis, and aporia",Steven Rozenski,,2003,2003-01-01,,,dissertation,en,,"This thesis examines the interaction between mystical theology and social justice, particularly through the tropes of kenosis and aporia. I argue for a poetics of justice modelled on a practice of reading that incorporates both the kenotic and the aporetic. Contemporary literary theory provides a point of intersection for the disparate selection of texts analysed over the course of the essay: through the works of Jacques Derrida, I develop a notion of justice that requires an exegetical openness and interdisciplinarity that focuses on the textuality of mystics, philosophers, and novelists. The first two sections provide a broad overview of the theoretical foundations of the thesis: Derrida's analysis of justice as a fundamentally aporetic concept is used as a point of departure. Section Three offers an analysis of critical terms used in the course of my investigation. Section Four uses the work of Michel de Certeau, Maurice Blanchot, Dorothee Soelle, and S.T. Coleridge in order to investigate the unique linguistic characteristics of mysticism and their relationship to justice. Section Five outlines the ontological characteristics assumed in this investigation and draws primarily on the thought of Jean-Luc Marion. Section Six uses Elaine Scarry's work to analyse the relationship between aesthetics, mysticism, and justice. Section Seven investigates the works of three major figures of Neoplatonic and apophatic mysticism: Pseudo-Dionysius, the Cloud-author, and Meister Eckhart.

,"Religion, atheism, and the crisis of meaning in Julia Kristeva's critique of modernity",David Koloszyc,,2010,2010-01-01,,,article,en,,"This study examines the development of Julia Kristeva's thought on religion and its relevance to her critique of modernity. The study argues that Kristeva's concern with the 'crisis of religion' occupies a central place in her work and permeates all of her inquiries into the linguistic, textual, literary, epistemological, subjective, social, political, and ethical dimensions of what she considers an all-encompassing 'crisis of meaning' in contemporary Western culture.%%%%Chapter one considers the manner in which Kristeva's early textual practice emphasizes the necessity of a multifaceted response to the 'crisis of meaning' by situating her concepts of negativity, productivity, ambiguity and intertextuality between Maurice Blanchot's thought of the neuter and Jacques Derrida's thought of differance.%%%%Chapter two addresses Kristeva's effort to affirm the capacity of modern literature to inscribe a new experience of meaning into the metaphysical void left in the wake of the 'death of God', with particular attention paid to the distinct ways in which she and Blanchot conceptualize the correspondence between literary experience and the experience of atheism.%%%%Chapter three explores the critical tensions that accompany Kristeva's psychoanalytic engagement with religious texts and her changing assessment of their significance for the experience of contemporary subjectivity. The chapter also examines the proximity between Derrida's encounter with negative theology and Kristeva's encounter with 'the unnamable' at the intersection of psychoanalytic and religious language.%%%%Chapter four investigates Kristeva's analysis of the 'crisis of secularism' at the turn of the millennium as well as her growing concern with the reduction of human knowledge and experience to techno-scientific and economic logic in late modernity, the limits and possibilities of liberal democracy, and the necessity of a fundamental reassessment of the religious dimensions of Western humanism.%%%%Seen as a major thread that links all of her critical endeavors, Kristeva's engagement with religion allows for a better understanding of the nuances, transformations, and impasses of her thought. Consequently, this inquiry opens new questions concerning the 'religious' character of the 'speaking subject', offers extensive contributions to a critical reconsideration of the social, political, and ethical implications of the relationship between religion and secularism, and draws attention to the indispensability of an elaborate cultural encounter between religious and humanist discourses in the 21st century.%%%%Cette these a pour but d'examiner le developpement du concept de religion chez Kristeva et d'analyser son importance par rapport a la critique kristevienne de la modernite.

,… IL ME FAUT VOUS APPRENDRE A M’APPRENDRE A ME LIRE…,Eberhard Gruber,,2007,2007-11-01,DOAJ (DOAJ: Directory of Open Access Journals),,article,it,,"Eberhard Gruber, … Occorre che vi insegni ad insegnarmi a leggermi La scomparsa di Jacques Derrida scrive e chiude l’ultima pagina delle commosse commemorazioni che il filosofo dedico a colleghi ed amici, dal 1980 con la morte di Roland Barthes a quella di Maurice Blanchot nel 2003. Chaque fois unique, la fin du monde (Ogni volta unica, la fine del mondo), la raccolta che riunisce tra altri i ritratti di Michel Foucault, di Edmond Jabes, di Sarah Kofman, di Gilles Deleuze, di Emmanuel Levinas, di JeanFrancois Lyotard, impone alla «melancolie sans âge» (la malinconia senza eta) di fare i conti con la memoria al presente. Ma «Chi ormai fara da testimone al testimone?» come scrisse Paul Celan nella poesia (commentata a lungo da Derrida) Aschenglorie (cenerigloria). Testimonianza, memoria, confessione, circoncisione: Circonfession (circonfessione); nel ventiquattresimo periodo del libro (dedicato alla memoria della madre), Derrida scrive appunto il me faut vous apprendre a m’apprendre a me lire (occorre che vi insegni ad insegnarmi a leggermi). L’imperativo esprime l’obbligo di stabilire tra autore e lettore una relazione interattiva e reciproca di scritturaletturatraduzione: la mia lettura del mio scritto e gia da sempre la lettura da un altro del mio scritto; essa implica un altrocomelettore che condivida processo lettoriale e comprensione e che traduca la scrittura in lettura. Ma il compito del lettore chiamato a leggere “per l’autore” e per se stesso e esposto al rischio di letture contrastanti: autentico “traduttore” sara colui che riuscira a farle convergere, a leggerle collegandole; evitando quindi di cadere o nella “parafrasi di un presupposto deriddiano”, o nell’ ”arbitrarieta lettoriale”. La frase di Derrida e un invito alla performativita lettoriale: non a formulare semplicemente la lettura deriddiana ma a fare riformulare una lettura dello scritto deriddiano con parole altre che non quelle gia scritte, con il fine di implementarne il senso. La traduzione per Derrida si situa sempre nell’entredeux dello scritto in quanto scritto e dello scritto in quanto lettura prefissata. Derrida si legge “traducendosi”, facendosi tradurre da un altro se stesso, da un altro da se. L’etica, la responsabilita, il rischio della traduzione stanno in quella condivisione della “performativita”, ma anche nell’intervallo, nell’intercapedine, nel ritirasi del traduttore nell’accettazione dell’impossibile possibilita, nell’assunzione dell’irriducibilita dell’idioma. Derrida, rigoroso e scrupoloso traduttore di Husserl, formula l’aporia: Rien n’est traduisible. Tout est traduisible (Nulla e traducibile. Tutto e traducibile), completandola con: “l’intraducibile e traducibile” e “il traducibile e intraducibile”. Questa relazione contraddittoria rimanda a quei paradossi evidenziati da Walter Benjamin, ne Il compito del traduttore: «Ma la traduzione non si trova, come l’opera poetica, per cosi dire all’interno della foresta del linguaggio, ma al di fuori di essa, dirimpetto ad essa, e, senza porvi piede, vi fa entrare l’originale, e cio in quel solo punto dove l’eco della propria lingua puo rispondere all’opera della lingua straniera »[1]. La lettura che Derrida propone del Mercante di Venezia, dimostra quanto lo scarto tra logiche opposte, la consapevole distorsione del linguaggio e dei concetti, l’assenza di traduzione condivisa (senza equivalenza, ne reciprocita non c’e perdono possibile, ne giustizia) portano al trionfo dell’inganno e della derisione. L’etica della traduzione sta invece nella modestia del compito, nell’umile riconoscimento di equivalenze, nella relazione non possessiva ne dominatrice tra leggere e scrivere, sotto il segno della condivisione e della reciprocita. Il lavoro dell’umano traduttore, ne passiva imitazione ne pretesa di origine, accompagna l’opera al suo stesso livello, come l’esecuzione musicale di uno spartito: l’opera e orchestrata dalle sue letturetraduzioni.

Arnett,,2003,2003-06-01,Argumentation and Advocacy,,article,en,False,"Emmanuel Levinas, considered the premier voice of ethics in the twentieth century, continues to manifest significant and continuing impact on twenty-first century postmodern scholarship providing a challenging communicative argument that displaces the privileged view of in the study of ethics. Agency assumes that an autonomous individual acts upon human life through self-generated volition. Levinas begins by countering the assumption the primacy of self-willed agency, detailing a phenomenological alternative--responsiveness to the Other. The I finds identity in response to the Other. Understanding the self as derivative rather than originative moves concern for the Other and the historical situation into privileged territory. The I or self emerges as a by-product, a responsive derivative construction. Levinas's ethics begins with answering the call of responsibility from the face of the Other, attentive to the call of the Other that shapes the identity of the I as a by-product. The uniqueness of Levinas's argument is akin to Marx's turning Hegel upside down. Levinas reframes the self from a willful agent to a responsive creation, moving from a traditional focus on autonomy and independent agency to interhuman responsive action responsible for the Other (Arnett, Dialogic Ethic 'Between' Buber and Levinas: A Responsive Ethical 'I'). Levinas argues that ethics is first philosophy, turning upside down conventional assumptions willfulness and beginning origins of the self. Levinas posits a phenomenological alternative to conventional self-construction, leaving us with alternative assumptions responsiveness and the construction of the I. His argument for communicative consideration is the origin of the self, which he begins with the Other, not self-will. Jacques Derrida, profoundly influenced by Levinas, cited Levinas's close friend Maurice Blanchot on the importance of Levinas's voice: However, we must not despair of philosophy. In Emmanuel Levinas's book [Totality and Infinity]--where, it seems to me, philosophy in our time has never spoken in a more sober manner, putting back into question, as we must our way of thinking and even our facile reverence for ontology--we are called upon to become responsible for what philosophy essentially is, by welcoming, in all the radiance and infinite exigency proper to it, the idea of the Other, that is to say the relation with autrui. It is as though there were here a new departure in philosophy and a leap that it, and we ourselves were urged to accomplish. (Blanchot qtd. in Derrida, Adieu to Emmanuel Levinas 8-9) For postmodern scholars, Levinas repositioned philosophy and the study of ethics--moving metaphysical theoretical discussion to attentiveness to phenomenological reality. The reality Levinas envisioned was phenomenological, not metaphysical. Ethics for Levinas is a phenomenological reality--one attends to the Other, not out of theoretical dictum, but from the call of a phenomenological reality witnessed as a trace in the face of the Other. This essay frames Levinas's argument--the responsive construction of the self--and its application to the study of communication and rhetorical studies, offering communicative insights that interpret otherwise than conventional Western assumptions the self. This essay engages books on Levinas in order of difficulty of engagement with attention to increasing complexity of Levinas's project. To that end, this essay begins with two books about Levinas (Manning's Interpreting Otherwise than Heidegger and Derrida's Adieu to Emmanuel Levinas), moving to a transcript of a radio interview with Levinas (Ethics and Infinity), ending with two major works of Levinas (Otherwise than Being or Beyond Essence and Totality and Infinity). This essay outlines Levinas's counter-argument concerning the privileged position of the self in Western culture, underscoring major ideas that shape his work and offering entrance into Levinas's thought from invitational to more demanding primary reading. …",Argument (complex analysis) | Argumentation theory | Biochemistry | Chemistry | Epistemology | Philosophy | Sociology,https://openalex.org/W37936655,30.0,,OpenAlex,9

This article considers a number of exchanges between French and German philosophers in the late twentieth century, focusing on the theme of translation. Taking Derrida’s intervention as a starting point, the article moves on to explore Victor Klemperer’s analysis of the German language under Nazism, Derrida and Maurice Blanchot as readers of Heidegger, Paul de Man and Derrida’s interpretations of Walter Benjamin’s ‘Die Aufgabe des Übersetzers’, in the context of the post-war French reception of German thought. The article concludes with a discussion of ‘untranslatability’, as developed by the French philologist and philosopher, Barbara Cassin, in her Dictionary of Untranslatables (2014), taking the history of the concept and word ‘subject’ as a way of reflecting on Europe’s identity, past, present and future.",Archaeology | Art | Art history | Biology | Computer science | Context (archaeology) | Deconstruction (building) | Ecology | Epistemology | Feminism | Gender studies | German | German idealism | Hegelianism | History | Library science | Linguistics | Literature | Nazi Germany | Nazism | Operating system | Philology | Philosophy | Sociology | Subject (documents) | Theme (computing),https://openalex.org/W2789136469,0.0,,OpenAlex,9

All further references to this edition of The Oxford Literary Review will be given in the main body of the text. 2. See my ‘Auditing Derrida’, Parallax (2004) 10, pp. 3–18, with which the present essay might be paired. In the first section of ‘Auditing Derrida’, I explore in greater detail various connections in the etymological and lexical chains which include ‘audit’, ‘auditory’, and ‘auditorium’, all of which suggests the auratic, theatrical, and juridical aspects of a hearing, those that remain or return in order to establish parergonal conditions which threaten to destabilize the very discourse and practice of today's audit culture. 3. I use the term ‘medium’ here in the sense developed by Samuel Weber, notably in his essay ‘The future of the university: the cutting edge’, in Institution and Interpretation (Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 2001), pp. 220–35. See pp. 230–1. It is interesting, here, that Weber sees traditional academic scholarship as advancing in pursuit of the not-yet-known, as if the unknown could be construed as just the negative other of knowledge, which then becomes an instrument in overcoming or mastering the unknown as not-yet-known. But with widespread effects of virtualization in the contemporary period, notably those which begin to unsecure the institutional site of the university as a definite place – a campus – ‘the unknown becomes, as it were, the element or medium of knowledge, not merely its negative other’. This is because ‘virtuality emerges not as a possibility to be realized or actualized’ in a ‘present’ or a ‘known’, but becomes instead the very condition of knowledge. Yet, albeit in different language, a similar thing might be said of judgement in the arts and humanities, going back at least as far as Kant. 4. The ‘event’ or ‘experience’ of teaching as deconstructible is something I attend to in my essay, ‘Teaching deconstruction: giving, taking, leaving, belonging, and the remains of the university’, Diacritics, 31 (2001), pp. 89–107. Here, the aleatory and unforeseeable aspects of teaching imply new or unrecognized kinds of responsibility and negotiation not simply bound to notions of the autonomy or (academic) freedom of the classical subject, whether master or pupil. The argument here draws in large part on a reading of Derrida's ‘Otobiographies: the teaching of Nietzsche and the politics of the proper name’, in The Ear of the Other: Otobiography, Transference, Translation (Lincoln and London: University of Nebraska Press, 1988), pp.1–38. 5. As the present essay unfolds, I relate this videotaping of the proceedings at Cork to Derrida's analysis, in a 1993 interview with Bernard Stiegler, of the complex interplay of evidence and testimony, illustrated notably in terms of the videotape shown during the Rodney King trial. 6. The allusion here is to Derrida's ‘Otobiographies’, which I discuss more fully in my essay ‘Teaching deconstruction’. 7. For a further treatment of the terms and ideas found here, see once again the opening stages of my essay ‘Auditing Derrida’. 8.

Until the late 1960s, this impact derived mainly from his early magnum opus, Being and Time (published in 1927). Many of the twentieth century's most significant continental thinkers – including Hannah Arendt, Rudolf Bultmann, Hans-Georg Gadamer, Jürgen Habermas, Emmanuel Levinas, Herbert Marcuse, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Jean-Paul Sartre, and Paul Tillich – acknowledge profound conceptual debts to the insights elaborated in this text. Being and Time was never finished, however, and Heidegger continued to develop, refine, and in some places revolutionize his own thinking for another fifty years. This ""later"" Heidegger's prolific body of work decisively influenced the next generation of continental philosophers, helping to shape the concepts and concerns of major contemporary figures such as Jean Baudrillard, Maurice Blanchot, Jacques Derrida, Hubert Dreyfus, Michel Foucault, Luce Irigaray, Jacques Lacan, Richard Rorty, and Charles Taylor, to name but a few. Despite this unparalleled impact, however, important aspects of Heidegger's later philosophy remain obscured by confusion and controversy.",Art | Art history | Confusion | Continental philosophy | Epistemology | Literature | Magnum opus | Philosophy | Psychoanalysis | Psychology,https://openalex.org/W2498587228,0.0,,OpenAlex,9
